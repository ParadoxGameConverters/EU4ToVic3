# This file maps EU4 religion GROUPS to Vic3 religion TRAITS, optionally adding taboos.
# Icon refers to Vic3 RELIGION and will use whatever that religion uses.
#
# link = { vic3 = trait eu4 = religious_group taboo = some_taboo taboo = other_taboo icon = religion }
#
# This means ANY EU4 religion not directly mapped in religion_map.txt, belonging to RELIGIOUS_GROUP will 
# get TRAIT, taboos (SOME_TABOO, OTHER_TABOO), and will use icon that vic3 RELIGION uses, while retaining its name.
#
# If you want to custimize specific religions, use religion_map.txt file, and bbe sure to add its definitions to
# blankMod/output/common/religions/ folder, along with icons to gfx/interface/icons/religious_icons/.
