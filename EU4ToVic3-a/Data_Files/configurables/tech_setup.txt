# Technologies are assigned reverse median values; from 0 (everyone has them) to 100 
# (only one nation has it). Score 50 means half the nations will have this tech.
#
# This is based on vanilla tier distribution (1->7): 5|48|41|83|30|51|(55 ignored) = 257(+55 decentralized ignored) total, distributed:
# T1  |T2   |T3   |T4   |T5   |T6
# 1.9%|18.7%|16.0%|32.3%|11.7%|19.8%
# 98  |79   |63   |30   |19   |0
#
# Techs within "same tier" are sorted so that ones with prereqs from the same tier come
# earlier (line_infantry 61 -> army reserves 70). Also, artistic licence.
