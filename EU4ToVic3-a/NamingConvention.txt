1. Scraper - something that doesn't rely on commons to load data (like definitions.csv)
2. Parser - something used to load PDXscript data for use in some processor
3. Mapper - something initialized by stuff in configurables
4. Loader - something initialized by stuff in installations
5. Manager - endpoint for mappers and loaders, smart class with internal processing logic.

Loaders and Mappers drive the parsers and scrapers, Managers drive loaders and mappers.
