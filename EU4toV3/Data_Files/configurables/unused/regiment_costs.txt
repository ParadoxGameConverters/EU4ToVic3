# These costs represent the raw strength of EU4 regiments needed to generate a single V2 regiment
# See file "unit_strength.txt" to see how much strength each EU4 regiment counts for

# Current values are based off typical near-endgame EU4 land regiments being converted 3-to-1,
# since V2 uses 3000-man regiments instead of EU4's 1000-man regiments,
# and by number of cannons to get roughly 1-to-1 conversion of near-endgame ships.

infantry = 135		# 45 points per 1000 -> 3000 man regiments
cavalry = 135		# 45 points per 1000 -> 3000 man regiments
artillery = 120		# 40 points per 1000 -> 3000 man regiments
heavy_ship = 180	# 3-to-1 for threedeckers
light_ship = 90		# 3-to-1 for heavy frigates
galley = 90		# 9-to-2 conversion for archipelago frigates (converted into light ships in vicky)
transport = 72		# 3-to-1 conversion for all transports (based on modified unit_strength.txt)
