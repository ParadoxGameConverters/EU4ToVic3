# Configuration for randomising RGOs, if the user selects that option
# in the setup screen. Provinces will be placed in the first bucket
# that matches their climate and terrain, and the provided fraction of
# that bucket will be shuffled. Note that 'any' is allowed for both
# climate and terrain, and matches anything. Ocean provinces are never
# shuffled; provinces for which terrain or climate information is
# empty never match a bucket.
