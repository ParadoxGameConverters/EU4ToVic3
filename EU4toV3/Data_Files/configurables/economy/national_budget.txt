# This is the baseline national budget that all countries will use
# Sectors marked as industrial will get severe penalities for countries without a full industrial score

# Sector weights may be modified by Vic3 laws, colonial status

# The national budget forms the country's opinon of what should be built,
# but still must face the realities of technology/resource availability and the desire of the states.
