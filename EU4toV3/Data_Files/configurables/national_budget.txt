# This is the baseline national budget that all countries will use
# Sectors marked as industrial will only be fully utalized by fully industrail countries
# Sectors marked as agarian will be boosted by non-industrial countries

# Sector wieghts may be modified by Vic3 laws, estates, or select EU4 gov reforms

# The national budget forms the country's opinon of what should be built,
# but still must face the realities of technology/resource availability and the desire of the states.
