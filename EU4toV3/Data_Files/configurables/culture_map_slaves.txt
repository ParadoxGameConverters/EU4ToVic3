## Slave generation
# For countries whose primary culture is the listed Vic3 master culture, all slaves in it will be re-assigned another culture
# Usage:
# link = { master = [culture] slave = [culture] }
# If a master culture has no slave culture defined, slaves will be of the same culture as master ones
# The calculation is done BEFORE colonial culture dynamic generation

link = { master = british slave = afro_american }
#link = { master = british slave = afro_caribbean }
