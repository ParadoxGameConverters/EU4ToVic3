# This file allows chosen government forms and ideas to affect socio-political reforms, 
# national value, starting technologies as well as starting tech groups and literacy. 
# For ideas to have an effect, entire idea group must be completed.
# 
# Each government type and idea ranks various issues on a scale of 0 to 10 where:
# 0 - Vehemently oppose or prevents (Over my dead body)
# 5 - Couldn't care less / does not affect an issue
# 10 - Strongly boosts / promotes
# 
# If an issue is not listed, it counts as being at level 5 (ignored)
# 
# Issues recognised: 
# Political: slavery, upper_house_composition, vote_franchise, voting_system, public_meetings, press_rights, trade_unions, political_parties
# National values: liberty, equality, order, literacy
# Technologies: army, commerce, culture, industry, navy
# Upper house membership: reactionary, liberal
#
# Note: slavery is counterintuitive - 10 means slavery abolished
