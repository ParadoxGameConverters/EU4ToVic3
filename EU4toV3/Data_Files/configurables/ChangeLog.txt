# User modding
###################
- Added [GetRootFromInsultNoun], which only prints the noun of the insult.
- Extended potential elective candidates and electors to include direct liege court and vassals and all de facto above lieges.
- Extended potential elective candidates and electors to include any character with a cached trait, this will unfortunately require some careful triggers to avoid some global characters ending up electors for a bunch of elective successions.
- Moved the nomads ignoring religion in marriage and taking consort to be a bool toggle on the government form, allowing this to be disabled or extended to other governments in mods.
- Added portrait_is_patrician trigger, usable only in portrait evaluation, it checks if the character is in a merchant republic and their employer patrician or has a republic government form.
- Added portrait_in_command trigger, usable only in portrait evaluation, it checks if the character is in command and leading any troops.
- Un-hardcoded the republic clothing, it now works as any other portrait does via the script.
- Added add_age = int effect, adds the given value to the age of the scoped character. Warning: messing with a character's age may have unintended side effects so use with caution.
- Added set_gender = male/female/opposite effect, sets the scoped character's gender to be male or female or the opposite of what they currently are. Warning: messing with a character's gender may have unintended side effects so use with caution.
- Added set_holy_site effect, sets the scoped title to be a holy site of the right hand side religion. Warning: this lets you have more than 5 holy sites which might cause weirdness, also adding holy sites to a religion but not its heresies will cause their icons to show up individually on other shared holy sites instead of being hidden like normal.
- Added remove_holy_site effect, removes the scoped title from being a holy site of the right hand side religion. Warning: this lets you have less than 5 holy sites which might cause weirdness, also removing holy sites from a religion but not its heresies will cause their icons to show up individually on other shared holy sites instead of being hidden like normal.
- Added set_holy_site_with_heresies effect, sets the scoped title to be a holy site of the right hand side religion and its heresies. Warning: this lets you have more than 5 holy sites which might cause weirdness.
- Added remove_holy_site_with_heresies effect, removes the scoped title from being a holy site of the right hand side religion and its heresies. Warning: this lets you have less than 5 holy sites which might cause weirdness.
- Added supply_limit trigger. Used in a province scope, it compares the supply in the province for a given character and their leader against a value. The leader defaults to the given character unless specified. eg: supply_limit = { for = scope <leader> = scope value > 10 }
- Updated the confusing is_bloodline_active trigger from needing to be in a character scope: it is now called "bloodline_is_active_for" instead and should now be used inside a bloodline scope, taking a character scope as its right hand side parameter.
- Added GetGirlWomanBoyMan custom loc key, which takes both age and gender into account.
- Fixed a crash in the realm view related to custom triggered modifiers.

# Balance
###################
- Prestige-based retinues are now unaffected by retinue reinforce rate; they always reinforce at full speed
- Your dynastic muslim vassals will no longer affect your Decadence through lost/won Holy Wars, as this caused your decadence to increase/decrease seemingly at random with no chance of affecting the outcome
- Book-type artifacts can no longer be stacked indefinitely, characters can now have max 4 books active at once (Library equipment slot)
- The titular Kingdom titles in Iberia (Galicia, Aragon, Castille and Portugal) are now only formable through decisions.
- The decisions to form the Kingdom titles in Iberia (Galicia, Aragon, Castille and Portugal) can now be done at any time, rather than only after the year 1000.
- The titular Kingdom title Moravia is no longer createable as a titular title.
- The titular Kingdom title Cyprus is now only formable through a decision (independent Catholic duke of Cyprus).
- The titular Duchy title Powys is now only formable through a decision.
- Vastly reduced the cost of Prestige buildings in Tribal holdings
- Added culture-specific buildings to Tribal holdings, when upgraded to Castles these buildings will become the castle variant of the appropriate culture building (Rank 2 Tribal building becomes Rank 1 Castle building, Rank 4 Tribal building becomes Rank 2 Castle building)
- Added a small tribal building chain for defensive pagans, built with Piety rather than prestige
- Added retinue size modifiers to several tribal buildings, allowing Tribal rulers to field much larger retinue stacks than they were able to previously
- Disabled the Decisions for Tribal realms to hire temporary troops for prestige/piety, they caused too much confusion for players (where did those 5000 troops come from?) and allowed for a much too rapid conquest (declaring multiple wars to avoid having them despawn), this is only in effect if Legacy of Rome is active
- Added several tribal-only retinues that are available to be recruited for Prestige (and Piety, for Defensive Pagans), intended to fill the niche decision-spawned troops had (prestige-based armies) without causing confusion/uncertainty
- Disabled all standard gold-costing retinues for Tribals, except for their cultural one
- The AI will no longer spawn random troops from Build Legend or Build Zeal as long as they're not at war (they often let the troops expire without using them, losing prestige/piety)
- Jizya tax is now based on any liege or the holding owner having a religion that uses Jizya, rather than just the holding owner
- When a new merchant republic house is generated from thin air, the new patrician comes with a family so that they can't as easily go extinct shortly after due to a single unfortunate death
- New patrician houses no longer love to name themselves after the ruler of the republic
- Harbor and Fishing Village buildings in Nomad holdings now provide a nominal amount of Galleys
- Rebalanced sex_appeal_opinion for several illness traits.
- Unified all gender triggers for minor titles, they should now make more sense
- Removed society influence.
- Improved religion tooltips, now also list: the scripture, evil gods, high god and gods
- The religion and culture line on the character select screen now gives the normal religion/culture desc and feature tooltips
- Added the name and icon of a religion to the religion top bar screen, applied the normal religion tooltip to both
- The Caspian Sea is now functionally like an ocean. With boats and merchant republics and stuff
- The Nestorian Patriarch has moved to Baghdad, he feels more at home there
- The Miaphysites and Monophysites don't really care about Pentarchy anymore
- The Tribal Invasion and Pagan Subjugation CB's now require the actor to either have the Tribal government form or Elective Gavelkind succession form
- Upon looting a holding, the loot protected by fort level is now immediately updated, rather than only on the next monthly tick
- Only bishops of Count level or above can be made into anti-Popes
- Most of the religious head actions now have a Piety cost that scales with either your size, or your tier and that of the target
- The real Pope can now grant claims and invasions on/within the realms of people who have an anti-Pope
- Donating money to holy orders is no longer incredibly overpowered: it now only gives 100 piety, and has a cooldown of a year between donations
- Successful Decadence invasions now destroy the primary titles of the one being invaded, which should help with muslim blobs becoming stronger after suffering a decadence revolt, as the new dynasty has 0 decadence
- Nomad troops have now been rebalanced to promote buying something but the first tier horde, also added piety based 'auxiliary' hordes
- Slight cost/effect rebalance of the Corrupt Priest decision.
- Barons can no longer take ambitions such as Become Exalted and Paragon of Virtue.
- The ambitions Paragon of Virtue, Exalted among Men and Paragon of Enlightenment have been rebalanced to reflect the higher values of Piety and Prestige present in the game.
- Corrupting Magic for Satanists is now a stacking modifier, and instead of removing health it actually provides a small health boost in the same way treatments do (it doesn't actually increase your health, it only offsets negative health). To compensate it has been given much heavier stat penalties. Major soul corruption effects will add two stacks of the modifier rather than one.
- Controlled Realm Inheritance now affects your realm instead of the DeJure region for the title. And it is now in effect as long as any title above the title being inherited has set Controlled Realm Inheritance to Illegal.

###################
# AI Improvements
###################
- Fixed an issue where ai rulers would not go raiding
- We have informed the AI that prestige-based retinues do in fact not cost any money, so it shouldn't refrain from buying them just because it is broke
- The Pope is no longer likely to personally excommunicate you just because he slightly dislikes the look of your face
- Told the AI that when it is the primary participant in one war that they should actually ignore wars where they aren't a primary participant
- Told the AI it might as well not bother to loot if it can't even muster 500 men
- The AI now, having decided it should send its retinues home, won't simultaneously decide leave them just sitting in the county of some random dude in the same realm, leading to the AI keeping its military AI alive indefinitely
- When the AI's council just absolutely refuses to let it grant a title to *anyone*, the AI now goes "well if one of you bastards want it, you can damn well have it" in order to get rid of the title
- When one AI tells another "please go over there so we can gather our forces", the AI won't go "meh, I don't really like that spot" and get stuck just alternating between staying somewhere it likes and walking towards where the other AI tells it to be, just because it previously hasn't considered the existence of that province
- The AI no longer thinks it is a brilliant idea to betroth its underage heir to a woman so old they'll be infertile by the time the betrothal can be turned into a marriage
- Told the AI that maybe it should consider that their liege has a ton of tribal vassals when their liege asks them to end a plot
- The AI now takes into account the cost you had to pay in order to send the interaction when evaluating if they should accept or decline.

###################
# Interface
###################
- Fixed the law view refreshing a lot more than it needed to, causing buttons to sometimes flicker
- Fixed it not being clear that negative command modifiers end up at 0 due to martial. Now shows "Martial Influence: x 0.00"
- When the Pope decides to excommunicate someone without someone asking them to, the notification now leaves out that it was "at Pope whatever's behest"
- The character finder now shows the effects of the characters' active artifacts
- Added an indicator on the "Play" button in the lobby for ironman saves showing whether achievements are available or not
- You can now edit your user-name in the multiplayer lobby to be different from your Steam name. Note that when restarting the game, it will still default to your Steam name
- The unit morale bar now shows the morale boosts and penalties being applied on a unit level
- Independent tributaries now show their suzerain where a liege would normally be shown
- Fixed the levy tooltip leaving out many sources of levy size
- The garrison tooltip now shows all sources of garrison size
- Fixed units that cannot be disbanded right now (E.G., due to shattered retreat) being included in the Confirm Disband pop-up
- Fixed title items when viewing a title in some cases being unclickable
- When you cannot pick a new plot due to your current plot being in motion, the game now properly informs you rather than just saying you don't have any plots available
- The rel head succession notification now uses the Pope's new name rather than their old name
- Trade post locations now show up in the Economy map mode as well, not just the Trade Zones map mode
- The levies tooltip in the character view now also lists how many troops they could potentially call to arms from tribal vassals
- Fixed missing space in "TribalVassal" and "NomadicVassal" in the "Pacts" list on the character screen
- When you are in regency and the council does not approve of a diplomatic action, you are now allowed to click the button, just not send it. This means you'll now be able to see why the council is voting against the action
- "Request Claim" is now visible on characters with requestable titles, not just in the title view
- Added sound to right-clicking a province on the map.
- Added experimental UI scaling. Changeable in the the video settings.
- The in-game barbershop is no longer enabled for characters that have neither hair nor beard-styles to choose from. And both hair and beard switch buttons will be hidden now if you don't have at least 2 styles to choose from
- Religious head title shield in religious view now shows its tooltip.
- Clicking the crusade banner while the crusade window is open will now close the window.

###################
# User modding
###################
- Fixed there being a strange scrollbar in the middle of the screen if you used the "-start_date" launch parameter with a title at the end
- Eliminated the "province_setup" folder. Now based purely on province history instead, meaning you no longer have to duplicate script
- Added is_connected_to trigger. Checks if two provinces are connected via some realm's territory. Used in province or county scope. Can be somewhat performance intensive, so use sparingly. Example:
	is_connected_to = {
		target = realm_capital # What province to find a connection to. Takes "capital" (province owner's capital), "realm_capital" (top liege's capital), or a scope that can be resolved to a province. Must be set
		sea_gap = yes  # Whether to allow pathing through gaps of a single sea province (E.G., between Genoa and Corsica). Defaults to "no". Can't path through lakes
		land_gap = yes # Whether to allow pathing through gaps of a single land province (E.G., a realm split in two by another realm a single province wide). Defaults to "no". Can't path through wastelands
		sub_realm = no # Which realm to allow pathing through. "yes" for the sub-realm of the province owner. "no" for the realm of the top-liege. Alternatively takes a scope that can be resolved to a character (E.G., ROOT, e_hre, or owner). Defaults to "yes"
		naval_distance = yes # Whether to allow pathing by sea (any number of provinces). Can take a number instead to use a max distance from already found ports
	}
- Added any_connected_province, any_disconnected_province, and random versions of both. Takes same parameters as is_connected_to, except for "target". The disconnected version scopes to every province in the sub realm that isn't connected, while the connected version scopes to every province that is. Example:
	any_connected_province = {
		sub_realm = ROOT
		limit = { some_trigger = no }
		some_effect = yes
	}
- Added can_naval_path_to trigger. Checks if it is possible to travel by sea between two provinces. Both provinces have to be sea or coastal. Example: "can_naval_path_to = c_london". Can take scopes and similar. Can be expanded to also take a distance: "can_naval_path_to = { target = c_london distance < 100 }"
- Added "persistent_event_target". Works like regular event targets, except are not saved in event chains. Instead they're saved in provinces, characters, titles, artifacts, societies, or offmap powers. They thus persist until cleared. Syntax is as follows:
	save_persistent_event_target = { name = name_of_target scope = event_target:my_character } # Scope is the scope to save. It'll be saved in whatever the current scope is scoped to, assuming it supports persistent event targets. Relative scoping like ROOT, liege, and similar work as well
	clear_persistent_event_target = name_of_target # Removes the given target
	persistent_event_target:name_of_target = { }   # Scopes to the given target
	[name_of_target.SomeLocCommand]                # Scopes to the given target in loc. In the case of collision with a regular event target, the persistent target takes precedence
- Variables now work in artifacts, societies, and offmap powers as well, not just characters, titles, and provinces
- Added console command print_holding_numbers. It prints the number of holdings defined for each county, sorted by # of holdings. Useful if you want to ensure all counties can support up to 7 slots
- Creating a holding in script when the province is already at its holding slot limit now adds another holding slot
- Added optional ai_acceptance section for decisions. This can be used to indicate to the player whether the target will accept a given decision. See 00_decisions.info for documentation
- Renamed the "decisions" section in societies to "powers" (though the old name still works). Now supports loc keys too, not just decisions. Will then use the key for the name, and the key + "_power_desc" for the extended description
- Added "society_influence = no" parameter for societies, which turns off the display of society influence
- You can now scope to landed titles in loc using their name. E.G., [k_norway.GetName]
- Fixed any_realm_lord not fetching the character's employer's sub-realm if used on an unlanded character
- For modifiers like those for council position choice, you can now specify a "localisation_key". When specified, that will make the condition show up as "Localisation: +xy" rather than as a regular trigger. This can be used to create much cleaner modifier lists. Especially useful for the "ai_acceptance" section of decisions, as that will make the display mimic normal interactions. Note that this does *not* work with multiplicative modifiers; only additive ones. This is for memory saving reasons, as applying it to mult modifiers would mean every single event MTTH and similar would need to store a loc key
- Stacking character modifiers now only show a single entry in the user interface
- Added "effect" parameter for on-actions, making it possible to fire effects directly off of on-actions. Useful for when you'd normally just use a hidden event. Highly recommended that you use scripted effects so as to not bloat the on actions file
- Wrote documentation for on-actions. Can be found in _on_actions.info in the on-actions folder
- Now possible to have several separate random event lists within an on-action, which are checked separately when the on-action happens (meaning several random events can occur; 0 or 1 per list). See _on_actions.info for documentation
- Made it clear that on_(major_)battle_lost/won do not fire for the actual army leader
- Checking "holding_type" in county (as opposed to province) scope should now work
- Added in_command pre-trigger for events. Takes yes or no. Example: in_command = no will make the event only trigger for people not commanding troops
- For custom loc purposes, notifications now provide FROMFROM as well. We won't pretend there's any real rhyme or reason to what character is FROMFROM
- It is now possible to specify characters' opinions of specific traits, and specify their opinion effect on people with specific traits. "lustful_opinion = 10" for example will now make Lustful characters like you more. "opinion_of_lustful = -10" will make you dislike lustful characters. Works in any modifier (E.G., traits, artifacts, event modifiers). Has to be defined in the modifier definitions folder, just like religion and culture opinion
- You can now define an opinion explanation for custom opinion modifiers like religion, culture, and trait opinion. Simply take the modifier key (E.G., "norse_opinion") and add "_EXPLANATION" to it, and write some loc. It gets post-fixed to the line in the opinion-breakdown. Defining one for Lustful for example might show something like "Attractice (effect on Lustful): +10"
- It is now possible to specify icons for objectives, decisions, and hardcoded interactions to show up in the diplomacy list (like how "plot to kill" has a dagger). For objectives and decisions, simply put "diplomacy_icon = GFX_gfx_name" and define that piece of GFX. For hardcoded interactions, the GFX name is pre-determined, using the format "GFX_<something>_icon", where "<something>" is the same as is used for offer descriptions, defines, and so on (E.G:, "DECLARE_WAR_INTERACTION"). By defining that GFX (in the case of war declaration, GFX_DECLARE_WAR_INTERACTION_icon), the icon will then show up
- Added effects add_special_interest and remove_special_interest. This will modify the special interests list in the outliner. Examples:
	add_special_interest = { who = k_france key = some_loc_key }
	remove_special_interest = ROOT
- Added triggers num_culture_provinces and num_religion_provinces. They check how many provinces there are of the given culture/religion. Should work in virtually any scope that has an associated culture. Takes comparisons. Example: num_culture_provinces > 10
- When debug_mode (AKA "charinfo") is active, the script tags of traits, modifiers, artifacts, cultures, religions, societies, and governments now get shown in their tooltip for use in console commands, script effects, and similar
- Added trigger society_has_active_progress = <yes/no>
- Added trigger society_progress = <value>
- Added effect start_society_progress
- Added effect stop_society_progress
- Added effect add_society_progress = <value>
- Added effect set_society_progress = <value>
- Added trigger holy_site_distance. Checks the distance to the nearest holy site of the target religion. Example: holy_site_distance = { target = FROM value < 200 }. Works with provinces, characters, and similar as targets as well, not just religions
- Added trigger religion_distance. Checks the distance to the nearest province of the target religion. Example: religion_distance = { target = FROM value < 200 }. Works with provinces, characters, and similar as targets as well, not just religions. Use with care, as it can get a bit expensive as it has to check distance to all provinces of the given religion
- Added console command "save_without_ironman" to save the current game-state without ironman
- The "version" console command now also puts the version info in your clipboard so you can paste it elsewhere
- Added "log_missing_adjectives" console command, which logs any title that has no adjective loc key defined (E.G., if the title "k_title" is defined, but no loc "k_title_adj" is defined)
- It is now possible for a religion to have autocephaly without having a pentarchy (though not the other way around). "autocephaly = yes" now only provides autocephaly, while "pentarchy = yes" provides both
- Added trigger "has_pentarchy". Works in anything that has a religion (religion, character, province, etc.)
- Added religion parameter male_temple_holders (default "yes") and trigger religion_allows_male_temple_holders
- Added the following effects, which change religion features. Works in religion scope, or a scope from which a religion can be gotten (character, province, county/barony title, title with religion defined, society with associated religion):
	set_peace_piety_gain
	set_pacifist
	set_convert_other_groups
	set_convert_same_group
	set_peace_prestige_loss
	set_ai_aggression
	set_unit_modifier
	set_unit_home_modifier
	set_hard_to_convert
	set_raised_vassal_opinion_loss
	set_piety_loss_for_attacking_same_religion
	set_max_wives
	set_max_consorts
	set_feminist
	set_heir_designation
	set_short_reign_opinion_year_mult
	set_jizya_tax
	set_can_retire_to_monastery

	set_can_grant_claim
	set_can_call_crusade
	set_pc_marriage
	set_bs_marriage
	set_psc_marriage
	set_cousin_marriage
	set_seafaring
	set_allow_looting
	set_allow_rivermovement
	set_autocephaly
	set_pentarchy
	set_religion_head # When used in religion scope, sets the title that controls the religion. Use "none" to set the religion as not having any controller. If a title already controls the religion when this is called, it will cease to control the religion. Example: set_religion_head = k_norway/ROOT/none
	set_uses_decadence
	set_can_have_antipopes
	set_priests_can_marry
	set_priests_can_inherit
	set_ignores_defensive_attrition
	set_character_modifier
	add_intermarry
	remove_intermarry
	clear_intermarry
	set_defensive_attrition
	set_female_temple_holders
	set_male_temple_holders
	set_branch_tag
	set_allows_matrilineal_marriage
- set_divine_blood effect now works on religions, not just characters
- Cultures and religions can now store flags, event targets, and variables
- Added effects set_flag and clr_flag, and triggers has_flag and had_flag, which work on anything that can store flags. Note as a result there are no culture/religion specific versions
- Event options can now take the parameter "tooltip_info_custom". Example: "tooltip_info_custom = REASON_IS_A_HORSE" will highlight the option and state that it is due to them being a horse
- Be aware that "reformer_head_of_religion" now has to be defined in the reformed version of the religion, *not* the original version
- Added a file with documentation in common/modifier_definitions
- Added triggers "trigger_if", "trigger_else_if", and "trigger_else". trigger_if is just an alias for conditional_tooltip. The latter two can be combined with trigger_if to handle complex display logic. If a trigger_if is immediately followed by a trigger_else_if or trigger_else, that trigger will be used instead if the limit/trigger of the trigger_if fails. They can be chained to virtually any extent. You can now also use "limit" instead of "trigger", to match how the effect functions. Example:
	trigger_if = {
		limit = { wealth = 3000 }
		piety = 1000
	}
	trigger_else_if = {
		limit = { wealth = 2000 }
		piety = 2000
	}
	trigger_else = {
		piety = 3000
	}
- Now possible to reference religions and their groups statically in loc. E.G., [catholic.GetName] or [christian.GetGroupName]. Note that referencing the group is really just a different way to reference the first member of the group, so "GetName" will return the first religion's name, not "Christian"
- Now possible to reference cultures statically and their groups in loc. E.G., [norwegian.GetName] or [north_germanic.GetGroupName]. Note that referencing the group is really just a different way to reference the first member of the group, so "GetName" will return the first religion's name, not "Christian"
- Buildings can now use "piety_cost" in order to cost piety. Mutually exclusive with gold and prestige costs
- Retinue subunits now support the parameter "costs_piety = yes". Mutually exclusive with gold and prestige costs
- Added parameter "sort_priority" for CBs, which can be used to decide the order in which CBs show up in the UI. Example: sort_priority = 1000
- Added parameter "diplo_view_region" for CBs, which can be used override which provinces are highlighted when the CB is selected in the diplomacy view. Example: diplo_view_region = custom_leon
- Fixed the presence of decadent dynasty members being based on the religion being Muslim rather than the religion using decadence
- Added command modifiers "light_cavalry", "knights", "archers", "pikemen", "actual_light_infantry", and "actual_heavy_infantry", which boost those specific units
- Event pictures can now have triggers, allowing you to define multiple pictures without having to go via event descriptions. Note that event description pictures will still take precedence
- Event pictures now always match the description if the description specifies a picture, rather than taking the picture from the first valid description. Example:
	picture = {
		trigger = { wealth = 1000 }
		picture = "GFX_evt_feast"
	}
- conditional_tooltip/trigger_if now returns "false" when it does not get displayed immediately inside an OR or NOR, as this gives a more sensible tooltip
- Added support for all of the effect any_<scopes> for a selection_score = { } - triggered score field that only executes the effect on the top scorers of selection. Example:
	any_society_member = {
		score_value = {
			value = 1
			additive_modifier = {
				society_rank == 4
				value = 1000
			}
			additive_modifier = {
				society_rank == 3
				value = 100
			}
		}
		count = 3
		add_trait = maimed
	}
- Added effects clear_prison_reasons, clear_banish_reasons, clear_revoke_reasons, clear_execute_reasons. These remove all opinion modifiers allowing the given action. Example: clear_prison_reasons = FROM will cause the currently scoped character to no longer be able to imprison FROM (unless allowed due to excommunication or being an enemy)
- "additive_modifier" in MTTHs and similar now works with decimal numbers rather than just integers
- Nicknames can now be set to prefix the ruler name with the is_prefix = yes attribute in the nickname database.
- Fixed the "succession" effect not immediately causing succession to recalculate
- Modifier definitions now support "show_value = no", which will cause no number to be shown. Can be useful for showing a modifier unlocks some sort of feature
- Dynasties are now generated for the senior party in a marriage to someone who has a dynasty, rather than always being generated for men if the woman has a dynasty
- Event options can now take "tooltip_info = combat_rating", much like they can take "tooltip_info = diplomacy" and similar
- Religions can now have a "full" name defined by adding the loc key with "_full" appended. Will be shown on the map, and in most UIs. Useful if you want a longer name on the map that does not work in all contexts. [Religion.GetName] will still get the old name, while [Religion.GetFullName] will get the longer version
- Virtually all triggers and effects that before only supported simple relative scopes (ROOT/PREV/FROM/etc) now support fancier ones (liege/top_liege/employer/capital/etc)
- Added Scripted score values similar to scripted triggers and effects. Can be utilized in ai_chance, ai_will_do, random list weighting and anything that utilizes the triggered modifiers to calculate a value.
- The "adjective" effect now supports custom loc. Like set_name, it uses the current scopes available
- Added effect "set_short_name = yes/no". Can be used in title scope. Equivalent to putting "short_name = yes/no" in the title's definition. Useful when renaming titles in script
- Added "preferred_limit" parameter for "random_" effects like "random_character". Should work for all "random_" effects except "random_quest_target", which is a bit of a mess. Multiple preferred limits can be defined, in addition to the regular "limit". When preferred limits are used, the first one that at least one target fulfills will be used in addition to the limit. If no preferred limit is fulfilled, only the base limit gets used. Very useful for when you want to pick a better target when one is available. Example:
	random_independent_ruler = {
		limit = { wealth < 1000 }
		preferred_limit = { culture = norwegian }
		preferred_limit = { culture_group = north_germanic }
		wealth = 1000 # This would give 1000 gold to a random independent Norwegian with less than 1k gold, if one exists. If none exists, it'll give it to a random independent North Germanic with less than 1k gold. If none exists, it'll give it to a random independent ruler of any culture with less than 1k gold
	}
- Societies "monthly_currency_gain" can now take "triggered_gain", making it possible to define any arbitrary reason to get currency. See societies.info for more info
- If you run grant_title on a barony that has not been built, now a castle will be built there
- Added character loc property GetLastWordInDynastyName. It will split the character's dynasty names on spaces and apostrophes, and return the last word. E.G., d'Anjou -> Anjou and "de Hauteville" -> Hauteville
- Added interface_skins = { } list in religion and religion groups. Determines the order a religion will use interface elements, taking them from the first listed to the last. The default interface is an implicit backup for all elements of all religions. If a republic then they will only use the republic interface if they have no interface_skin defined in their religion of religion group or have been set to merge the republic interface. The definition in the religion overrides that of the religion group
- Added merge_republic_interface = yes/no to religion and religion groups. Determines if a religion will try to merge their interface with the republic interface. If yes then when a republic and searching for a texture for their religion's interface they will look for <texture_name>_republic and use that version of the texture instead of the religion's normal one. The bool defaults to no and as with interface_skins the definition in a religion overrides that of the religion group
- Added triggers society_has_members, society_is_active, and is_society. Checks if the scoped to society has members, if the society's "active" trigger is true, and whether the society is the same as the right-hand-side. Examples:
	the_satanists = { society_has_members = yes society_is_active = yes is_society = ROOT/the_satanists/event_target:some_society }
- Women can now take consorts. Be aware that this may in some cases break your existing script
	- "add_consort" will now cause the person scoped to to be the senior party, rather than the woman. Same goes when adding one in history. "remove_consort" will still work on either party. The scopes remain the same, and will work regardless of who is the senior party
	- The trigger "is_senior_consort_party" has been added, which simply checks that the character has consorts rather than being someone's consort. Example: "is_senior_consort_party = yes"
	- is_consort now checks that you're the junior party, rather than female and having a consort
	- num_of_consorts now returns 0 for the junior party
	- title_male_consort also needs to exist in minor titles
	- A religion can be defined to allow women to take consorts using "women_can_take_consorts = yes" in the religion definition, or be enabled for the religion by event/similar using the new effect "set_women_can_take_consorts = yes". It can also be set in government definitions (but not dynamically) in the same manner.
	- Also added is "men_can_take_consorts" in religion and government definitions (defaults to yes), and a "set_men_can_take_consorts" effect for religions. If a religion/government's max consorts is 0, men/women_can_take_consorts has no effect
- Society ranks can now also define max_consorts, men_can_take_consorts, and women_can_take_consorts. Works as with religion and governments. You'll need to put a description of the effect in the rank manually, using the "powers" section or the "custom_tooltip" key
- LOOTER_SHIP_MAINT_MULT is now based on "seafaring" rather than being allowed to loot
- Added scopes "previous_artifact_owner" and "any/random_artifact_owner". These only work on artifacts that track history (don't have the "history = no" parameter). The first simply scopes to the previous holder. The any/random one scopes to anyone who has ever owned the given artifact (including the current owner)
- Added effect copy_artifact_history
- Multiple wives now take precedence over the ability to have concubines
- Added effect "show_trait". All this does is make the given trait show up on an event option, much like "show_portrait". It does not affect the gamestate, nor cause a tooltip. Example: "show_trait = genius"
- Variables, flags, and event targets can now be saved to societies. Example: the_satanists = { set_flag = test_flag }
- Fixed custom loc in some cases almost always returning the same "random" value when used repeatedly in a block of script
- Fixed the "new_artifact" scope not persisting past save-reload
- Added set_picture effect for artifacts
- When debug mode is enabled (AKA "charinfo"), you can now CTRL+right-click an event option to open it in a text editor. To specify what text editor to use, you will need to edit your settings file. "text_editor" needs to point to your text editor's executable, while "text_editor_postfix" needs to use whatever syntax that editor uses to specify what line to open on. The $ sign will be replaced with the line number
	text_editor="C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\notepad++.exe"
	text_editor_postfix="-n$"
- Added loc promotion ParentReligion, which changes the scope to the scoped religion's parent religion. Example: [Root.Religion.ParentReligion.GetName]
- Added scope parent_religion
- Added parameter full_hostility = yes for CBs. If set in addition to hostile_against_others, will cause anyone targeting a realm with a CB with the flag to be hostile towards one another. They will also be hostile to anyone targeting the defender's primary title
- Equipping an artifact now triggers a portrait refresh in case the artifact affects how the character looks/dresses
- Added on-actions on_command_unit, on_command_sub_unit, and on_unit_entering_province
- Added pre-trigger has_job_title. Takes yes or no
- Scripted value calculations such as ai_chance, ai_will_do, selection_score etc. now supports adding a trigger field effectively nullifying the field.
- You can now use command_modifier in event modifiers
- random_list now supports defining a fallback, which will be run if nothing else has a chance above 0
- random_list now leaves out "one out of x options will happen" if only one option is valid
- WARNING: The religion/religion_group/culture/culture_group event pre-triggers now only take actual keys (E.G., "norse"). Scopes and the like will no longer work, for performance reasons
- Fixed counties with no holder whatsoever in history getting all their barons set as independent
- Hovering over the tooltip for effects involving a lot of characters should now cause less game slowdown
- e_rebels and e_pirates no longer check decisions, plot invitations, etc.
- Fixed FROMFROM not being present most of the time in on_combat_pulse
- Added new Crusade system:
	- See crusade.info in common/religion for documentation
	- Now possible to have more than once Crusade CB. Use "is_crusade = yes" in the CB to mark it as a Crusade CB. Individual religions can also specify their Crusade CB, overriding what's defined on the group level
	- Added effects set_crusade_target, pledge_crusade_participation, lock_crusade_target, set_crusade_beneficiary, set_official_crusade_recipient, set_crusade_pot_multiplier, cancel_crusade
	- Added triggers is_preparing_crusade, crusade_preparation_strength, crusade_preparation_time_elapsed, crusade_preparation_time_remaining, has_pledged_crusade_participation, crusade_war_has_started
	- Added scopes crusade_beneficiary, crusade_target_title, crusade_target_char, any/random_crusade_participant, official_crusade_recipient
	- Added on-actions on_crusade_preparation_starts, on_crusade_launches, on_crusade_canceled, on_crusade_monthly, on_crusade_target_changes
- Added scope any/random_unit_leader. It scopes to any leader (flank or subunit) in a unit. It can be used in unit or character scope; in character scope it uses the unit that character is in. If the unit is in combat, every unit on the same side in the battle is included
- Added triggers is_sub_unit_leader = yes/no and is_in_same_unit_as = scope. The latter checks if two characters are in the same unit. Does NOT check every unit on a side of a combat, unlike any/random_unit_leader
- Warning: Identical names in cultures are now assumed to always be tied to the same base name. This means that having something like Name_BaseOne in one culture, and Name_BaseTwo in a different culture is no longer possible. This would already cause issues with regnal naming anyway
- Now impossible to fire delayed events (E.G., via laws automatically being passed) until the campaign has actually started, as this could lead to CTDs
- Added dynasty modifiers, which apply to all (living) members of a dynasty. Add with "add_dynasty_modifier = key" in character scope. Remove with "remove_dynasty_modifier = key". Check for their presence with "has_dynasty_modifier = key". Does not support timed modifiers
- Added triggers holding_garrison_percent, holding_raisable_levy_percent, and holding_total_levy_percent. They check how full the garrison, the raisable levy, and the total levy (garrison + raisable) is. Example: holding_total_levy_percent < 1 would check that the overall levy is not capped. 1 represents 100%, 0 is 0%
- Added variable exports holding_garrison_percent, holding_raisable_levy_percent, holding_total_levy_percent, holding_garrison, holding_raisable_levy, holding_total_levy
- Added effect set_player_character, which makes the player controlling the current character control the target character instead. Example: "set_player_character = player_heir" would result in the player taking over as their heir. Be careful, as it is entirely possible to cause an instant game over using this effect. The effect does *not* enforce remaining within the same dynasty. This effect works even in multiplayer, hence the need to be scoped to the player's character
- on_siege_over_winner, on_siege_over_loc_chars, on_siege_won_leader, and on_siege_lost_leader no longer fire for forts (they never fired at all for trade posts); these now fire the same on-action with "_fort" or "_trade_post" appended, with FROM as the province. This is because FROM was undefined for these two types of holdings as they have no associated title, leading to strange issues
- The names of interactions now go through custom localisation, just like their descriptions, providing the standard set of promotions and properties for interactions
- Intermarrying AI logic no longer assumes religions in the same group are fine to marry unless they've actually been specified to allow intermarrying. Before, only Pagans could refuse on religious grounds within the group
- The "add_building" effect now also adds the building it upgrades from. E.G., add_building = some_building_3 would add some_building_1 and some_building_2 first if they're not already present (based on upgrades_from, not names)
- Fixed religious titles not being considered minor titles for some purposes, such as "has_minor_title"
- Major rivers now use the position of the councilor for moving ships, to make it easier to place them in such a way that they're not on land
- Fixed the "adjective" effect not always working
- When a province is selected in debug mode, hovering over another province will show the naval distance if a naval path exists
- It is now possible to specify the religion head's response AI for all the religion head interactions. See 01_rel_head_actions.txt for more info
- You can now specify religion-specific character names on the religion level, not just the religion group level. If defined, it will be used instead of the religion-level names. It is now also possible to have one named defined in more than one group/religion (E.G., in both the Christian group and the Jewish group), while before this would lead to no one being able to use the name at all
- Added "prompt_name" effect, which can be used to let the player rename characters, provinces, landed titles, artifacts, and bloodlines. Example:
	prompt_name = {
		player = ROOT # What player should get the prompt
		type = NEWBORN # What message type to use, as defined in messagetypes.txt. This is what defines the text and picture. The text uses the current scopes
		portrait = e_hre # Optional. What portrait to show on the right. If not defined, the scoped character (if scope is a character) will be used
		name_list = LOC_KEY # Optional. What name list to use. Can also use "religion" for religious names of the scoped character's religion, or "culture" for cultural names. If not specified, there will be no "randomize name" button (except for characters, that'll use the standard buttons for newborns). The loc key should contain a list of names separated by pipes. E.G., "LOC_KEY;Name|Name2|Name3;;;;;;x". When the name list is specified, a name from the list will be chosen at random, and hitting "randomize name" will cause the name to change to another random name in the list. When using a loc key rather than culture/religion, custom loc is supported, using the current scopes
	}
- Added on-actions on_character_renamed, on_title_renamed, on_province_renamed, on_artifact_renamed, and on_bloodline_renamed. These fire when a player renames such an object
- Added on-action on_excommunicate_interaction
- Added religion parameter rel_head_defense. If set to "yes", people of that religion are likely to join in defense of their rel head when attacked by a different religion. It can also be set in script using "set_rel_head_defense = yes/no"
- Added defines MAX_DISTANCE_HOLY_WAR_JOIN and MAX_DISTANCE_REL_HEAD_DEFENSE_JOIN
- Added CB effects on_invalidation_title and on_invalidation_posttitle
- Fixed holding build triggers not working for regular holdings
- Added can_land_path_to trigger
- Fixed the exportable value monthly_income actually returning the yearly income
- Added localisation modifier 'U' to uppercase first letter
- Province history renaming now supports taking a localisation tag
- Added any/random_eldership_title scopes
- Added any/random_elector_character scopes
- Added any/random_pretender scopes
- succession and succession_w_cooldown effects can now be complex and use base_type and voting_rules as parameter, example:
succession = {
	base_type = feudal_elective # One of the hard-coded types feudal_elective, elective_gavelkind, tanistry
	voting_rules = my_elective_voting_rules # Elective rules defined in common/succession_voting
}
- Added extra script validation that tries to detect if a curly bracket or equal sign is missing or in the wrong location.
- christian_church_opinion can now be used outside of traits and there is now a version for each religion group.
- Added two on_actions; "on_employer_change" and "on_host_change" which are triggered whenever a character changes their employer (home court) or host (current location).
- Added a scripted trigger "valid_exile_court_trigger" which makes it possible to limit which courts the game considers when deciding where to move a character.
- Fixed "spawn_disease" not working in events due to load order shenanigans. Now also logs during game load if a referenced disease does not exist
- Added DAYS_BEFORE_FIRST_COMBAT_EVENT in defines
- Added 'add_god_names' effect which makes it possible to add new god names to the scoped religion
- Added 'remove_god_names' effect which makes it possible to remove all god names from the scoped religion
- Added 'set_high_god_name' effect which makes it possible to set the name of the high god for the scoped religion
- Added 'add_evil_god_names' effectwhich makes it possible to add new evil god names to the scoped religion

###################
# AI Improvements
###################
- Told the AI that it a bad idea to recruit retinues if the place where they spawned has enemy troops in it
- Gave the AI a few pointers on the existence of ships when it comes to getting its troops back home after a war
- The AI now realizes that simply pretending enemy holy orders don't exist doesn't actually help it win wars
- The AI no longer briefly forgets about one of its armies, and thus decides to merge some armies together, leading to it then deciding they need to be split, forgetting about one of them once more, starting the cycle all over again
- The AI will no longer run in circles trying to attach to someone of lower tier, being constantly told "no, you can't do that". We didn't actually make the AI any smarter in this regard; we just removed the tier restriction on attaching
- Told the AI that the war goal should always be considered within its area of operations, stopping it complaining that that it is a bit too far away and deciding not to go there
- Told the AI for landless characters that during a war, the war goal is actually a lot more important than whatever provinces it happens to have occupied
- Informed the AI that it is a bad idea to abandon a siege you control just because there's enough other people besieging it. On top of the AI now knowing how to remain in control of a siege, the AI will no longer collectively all at once decide to abandon a siege reasoning "someone else will pick up the slack"
- Told the AI it is a decent idea to merge its armies even if there's no enemies around to fight, assuming that has no real risk of causing supply issues
- Informed the AI that if it has the max possible warscore from occupation, it might actually be a good idea to try to hunt down enemy units instead of sieging for months or years on end
- Fixed non-player characters without AI (barons) not dismissing their levies
- Told the AI that once it has decided it no longer has any real reason to converge its forces it should actually... stop converging those forces on whatever target originally made sense
- The AI no longer gets horribly confused when armies it is ordered to attach to merge with another army
- Told the AI that while we're very impressed that it now manages to discount enemy holy orders when appropriate, it might be a good idea to also discount its own holy orders rather than try and fail to attack someone who cannot be targeted by said holy order

###################
# Interface
###################
- Fixed the music cutting out when muted, rather than slowly fading out. Also fixed the song restarting when unmuted rather than continuing from where it left off
- Fixed the combat modifier icon not being shown if the character has a negative personal combat rating, but no command effects

- Changed the shortcuts for cycling over holdings in the holding view from ',' and '.' to 'b' and 'n'
- Fixed participation scaled piety/prestige/decadence not showing up in war tooltips before the war has been declared

- The levy bar in the province view now states the maximum reinforcement rate for the levies; that is, the rate they will reinforce if there is room for more troops
- CTRL+click on campaign funds for cardinals and patricians will now invest just enough money to beat the current best candidate. This includes accounting for the random factor for patricians. The value for SHIFT+click has been increased from 50 to 100

- Told the AI that it isn't a good idea to grant a title to someone you just revoked a title off of, even if it is a duchy where you hold no land yourself, and that it might be a good idea to hold onto the duchy you just revoked for a little while before giving it away

# AI Improvements
###################
- Fixed one way AI characters that should have AI could end up with no AI
- The AI now actually considers the idea of sending its army to a province if its friends are there or adjacent, even if the province is otherwise a bit boring
- The AI now actually realizes that friendly armies standing near a potential target is a good thing even if it doesn't personally own those armies
- Once the AI gets to its allies it won't decide that if it can't attach due to supply, it is better for everyone if it just packs its bags and goes home. Instead it will now try to stick close
- The AI is now vaguely aware of the existence of tribal vassals when evaluating whether a faction has a real chance of succeeding
- The AI now checks to see exactly how many liege levies it'll deny its liege by revolting, rather than going "eh, half my levies I guess?"
- The AI now takes tribal vassals into account in most decisions where it considers how strong a potential enemy or ally is, rather than simply pretending they don't exist
- Fixed aggression from ambitions having 20 times as big an effect as intended
- AI will now also call allies to arms if the estimated answer is a "maybe," to force them into making a decision.
- Raiding adventurers now realize once they've been settled that maybe, just maybe, they should consider their new realm their base of army operations, and return armies there when they're not up to anything
- AI: Should be snappier to evaluate settlement decisions when needed
- If defensive pacts are disabled, the AI will no longer think no one could possibly be a threat to it
- AI: Made the Pope less reluctant to accept requests for excommunication
- AI (Conclave): Will never pick Heritage or Faith Focuses for children of the right culture and religion
- Tributaries are now always aware that their tributary relationship benefits their suzerain more than them, and that they could potentially break free
- The AI no longer gets increasingly reckless the more "rational" it is; being enlightened by your intelligence turns out not to make your troops any better
- The army AI no longer thinks that just because two destinations are pretty much equally good, it should switch back and forth between the two and thus never get anywhere
- The army AI now understands that if it has bothered to start a siege, maybe there was a good reason to do so, so we shouldn't just run off right after just because another destination looks very slightly better
- Taught the AI that more loot means a province is a better target for looting
- The army looter AI now actually realizes that if all the loot in a province is protected by holdings and the army isn't big enough to siege them, it isn't actually a good loot target
- The AI now considers any strong realm nearby a potential threat
- Taught vassals how to send alliance offers to other vassals
- Informed the AI that we changed how decadence works years ago and it shouldn't give titles to its family members just for the hell of it
- Told the AI that if it is the attacker in a war, it *might* be a good idea to actually go attack the defender even if you're targeting their whole realm rather than a specific title within it, and it is a bit of a long walk
- The AI has learned how to spell, and no longer look for "soceities" missions when they're actually called "societies" missions. With this newfound ability to spell, the AI is better at identifying mission targets
- Taught nomads that if they rise in revolt in response to an attempt to split their clan, maybe they should accept it next time rather than rise again and again
- The AI is no longer deathly afraid of going overseas to help its allies just because the enemy is a bit far away
- The AI no longer thinks that just because a province is *someone*'s capital, it's a good target; it is now more discerning and only cares if it is the capital of an enemy
- The AI is now a bit more aware of just how superior heavy cavalry is to light infantry
- The AI now no longer thinks that enemy armies adjacent to other enemy armies are just on vacation, and won't help out if it were to attack
- Gave the AI a crash course in how to hand out titles
- Gave the AI a crash course in how to transfer vassals in a way that won't make you want to claw your eyes out
- The AI now realizes that just because it has occupied everything it borders, it shouldn't skip out on occupying the non-bordering stuff
- Taught the AI a few things about how supply works, and why a doomstack isn't always the best way to deal with it while travelling to its destination. The AI is hard of hearing, so it only partially understood this lesson, but partial understanding beats no understanding, right?
- Taught the Pope Geography 101, with an emphasis on what "distance from Catholicism" and "size of kingdom" means in the context of Crusades, and why this means that invading India when Egypt is right there might be a bad idea
- Informed the AI that just because their ideal commander can't lead troops right now, doesn't mean they should just skip assigning a commander to the flank they wanted to assign that commander to
- The AI now realizes that once it is landed, it should base its army in its capital rather than have it stand in the middle of nowhere, taking attrition, just because it happened to spawn in the middle of nowhere many years ago
- Bethrothed men no longer go "nah, can't fulfill this betrothal" after sending a marriage offer which you accidentally reject. They will also no longer decide to not bother to resend the offer while mumbling "let's see how *they* like being ignored"
- Told just-spawned raiding adventurers "hey, your fleet is right over there" so that they wouldn't disband instantly when spawning on an island with no good raid targets, due to thinking that getting across the sea is simply impossible
- Members of small reformed religions are now a bit more fond of joining Great Holy Wars and the like
- The AI has finally come to the realization that it is allowed to invite its own vassals and courtiers to plots, not just the vassals and courtiers of the target

	- Added set_offmap_holder and set_offmap_name effects
	- Added has_offmap_name and has_had_offmap_name triggers

	- Added an offmap_powers history folder
	- Added is_offmap_ruler and is_offmap_governor triggers
	- The trigger is_within_diplomatic_range now works with offmap powers. This is equivalent to testing it against the governor. The same behavior will be used if the governor title or offmap ruler is scoped to

- Split the defines CONTESTED_TITLE_OCCUPIED_WARSCORE_BONUS and CONTESTED_TITLE_OCCUPIED_WARSCORE_BONUS_INDEP into attacker and defender version
- Split the 'ticking_war_score_multiplier' in Casus Belli scripts into 'att_ticking_war_score_multiplier' and 'def_ticking_war_score_multiplier'
- Added a new define for the effect of Fort Level on defender morale in sieges: FORT_LEVEL_MORALE_LOSS_REDUCTION_MULT
- Fixed a number of scopes not getting localised as effects, only as triggers
- error.log will now usually tell you if you've saved a map file in the wrong format
- The game will now crash slightly earlier if the province map is the wrong size (not a multiple of 64), making the issue easier to identify
- Cultures can now have "dynasty_name_first = yes" which puts the dynasty name before the personal name
- Added a "holding_types" folder in common. This can be used to define additional triggers for building each holding type
- The scaled_wealth trigger now supports "min" and "max" just like the scaled_wealth effect
- Fixed "effect" in history not being seeded, meaning that all effects with a random component would always produce the exact same result. Now the result will be properly randomized
- Build cost and build time modifiers now apply to forts, trade posts, and hospitals too. Note that there are still no type-specific modifiers for these three holdings
- on_heresy_takeover no longer creates a dummy character for the religion scope, but instead uses an actual religion scope
- "Religion" in loc while already in a religion will just return the same religion, to ensure that any loc written based on some on-actions using characters as makeshift religion scopes continue to work. The same has been done for "Culture" in culture scopes
- Most effects and triggers that take a number can now take a variable name instead, and will grab the variable from the current scope. E.G., "wealth = test_variable"
- gain_effect now fires in all cases (except history and death) for job titles and minor titles, including when added through script
- lose_effect or retire_effect now fires in all cases (except history and death) for job titles and minor titles. Being given a new job title will fire retire_effect on the old title, and gain_effect on the new title
- Fixed resigning as a commander firing lose_effect rather than retire_effect
- Added death_effect for job titles and minor titles, which fires when a character dies while holding the job/minor title
- Made the following console commands that before were only available to devs and beta testers available to everyone: guibounds, noai, join_society, leave_society, society_rank_up/down, society_currency, set_society_grandmaster, get_all_artifacts, activate_artifacts
- Added the console command "province_religion" or ("prov_rel") to change the religion of a province. Syntax is: "province_religion <province> <religion>"
- Targeted decisions now support having a 3rd party character or artifact
- Now possible to store variables in the same manner as event targets; any variable starting with "local_" will work this way, meaning it'll persist as long as the event chain does, but not be accessible outside it
- Uploading mods to Steam is no longer limited to 50MB
- Added the following targeted decision filters: court_including_me, home_court_including_me, dynasty_including_me, all_including_me, society_including_me, realm_including_me, sub_realm_including_me
- The regular versions of the above now consistently exclude the character themselves; in some cases before this restriction only applied if the AI was taking the decision
- Added max_defender_occupation_score and max_attacker_occupation_score modifiers for casus belli types
- Added documentation for the "aggression" parameter for governments
- Added a become_secret_heretic effect
- Added TRADE_ROUTE_SIEGE_MULTIPLIER and TRADE_ROUTE_OCCUPATION_MULTIPLIER defines
- Made the tributary system moddable and modular. You can now add new tributary types defining:
	- when and if the tributary relation breaks
	- what CBs the tributaries can use against their suzerain
	- The allowed_to_target_suzerains CB parameter no longer has any effect, as the above replaces it
	- if tributaries can unite together against their suzerain
	- if tributaries can fight against each other
	- if the suzerain can call their tributaries to arms, and if the tributaries are forced to join
	- if the tributaries can call their suzerain to their defense, and if the suzerain is forced to join
	- how much of what is paid by the tributary to the suzerain
	- What icon to use for the diplomatic relation
	- What modifiers to give the tributary
- The tributary system now functions even if Horse Lords isn't enabled, though the CBs and the like are still limited by DLC; this means you can now make your own tributary systems even without your mod's users having HL
- You can now use the is_tributary trigger to check for a specific type, and a specific suzerain
- You can now use custom loc in the is_tributary trigger
- The set_tribute_suzerain now takes a "type" parameter, specifying the type. If none is specified, "default" is used
- Added set_trade_route_base_value and set_trade_route_value_multiplier effects
- Provinces with several trade routes will now show the presence and effect of all of them in their tooltip
- Effect and trigger scope changes now have an optional "show_scope_change" parameter. If set to "no", the scope change won't be shown in the tooltip. It'll be shown as just "effect description" rather than "scope change: effect description". This functionality isn't supported by any/random scopes.
- Added hostages_block_cb parameter for CBs
- Variables that haven't been set yet now work in localisation; they'll show "0" rather than simply being blank. "GetName" works as well. So [global_test.GetName] will return 0 for GetValue, and the "global_test" localisation for GetName
- Fixed the is_interested_in_society trigger not localising properly if negated, and not ending with a linebreak
- Added interested_in_society_of_character trigger
- Fixed empty "OR" triggers in some cases crashing the game on launch
- show_as_title = yes for minor titles now works even if the character has no titles
- Fixed a crash that could happen when a selectable object overlapped with an impassable province
- Fixed setting someone's employer on the same date that employer becomes landed not working properly
- Fixed capital changes in some cases failing if the county holder became holder on the same day as the capital change
- Added as_if_allied_to parameter for gain_settlements_under_title, vassalize_or_take_under_title, subjugate_or_take_under_title, and vassalize_or_take_under_title_destroy_duchies. This ensures that land occupied by people in that character's war against the title's holder can be taken
- Castes can now be enabled for individual religions rather than being hardcoded to the Indian group. This is done using the "castes" parameter
- Removed various hardcoding associated with the Hindu religion. This is now connected to the "caste_opinions" parameter instead
- The subjugation opinion is no longer applied when using vassalize_or_take_under_title, just subjugate_or_take_under_title
- Added event pretrigger for Game Book
- Decisions can now have a "_desc_extra" localisation key defined. This will be shown after the Requirements section in its tooltip
- Added "conditional_tooltip"; defines when a given piece of trigger script should be displayed. Its contents are only evaluated if it is displayed
- Added government parameters gets_religion_opinion_penalties, gives_religion_opinion_penalties, and vassal_government_opinion_penalties. See _governments.info for documentation
- Added title parameters can_be_claimed and can_be_usurped. See 00_landed_titles.info for documentation
- Added "offmap_power" government parameters, which is used for the new succ_offmap_succession law
- You can now use "extended" (bracket-based) localization in Artifact scopes:
	- [GetName] will display the name
	- [Owner] will rescope to the current owner of the artifact
	- [OriginalOwner] will rescope to the original owner of the artifact
- There is now an AI exclusion pretrigger in decision "ai = no" that can be used to avoid decisions being considered by the AI at all
- Removed the "coalition_threat" CB parameter as it had nothing to do with coalitions
- Fixed rulers in some cases being considered to have no primary holding on the day of their death when going backwards in history
- Added console commands "print_global_flags" (aka "pgf") and "print_global_variables" (aka "print_global_vars" and "pgv"). They print whatever they're named after
- "character_info" aliased to "debug_mode" since it is used by more than just character to display debug info
- The Offmap Powers view will now display flags and variables that are set for offmap powers, including those of the title holders
- Added "attrition" character modifier. This will reduce/increase the attrition suffered by the army they command. It is capped at -99%
- Added "army_reinforce_rate" character modifier. This will make the army the character commands reinforce faster. Affects retinues and horde units as well, not just levies. Does not affect the reinforcement of the settlement itself. Cannot go below 0
- Added "days_of_supply" character modifier. This modifies the number of days of supply of the army the character commands by an absolute number of days. Days of supply cannot go below 1
- Added command modifiers phase_skirmish_attack, phase_pursue_attack, phase_melee_attack, phase_skirmish_defense, phase_pursue_defense, and phase_melee_defense
- Added scopes any_neighbor_independent_ruler and random_neighbor_independent_ruler. A "neighbor independent ruler" is a ruler that neighbors the realm you're in (E.G., the HRE if you're a count in the HRE)
- Added "demesne_size_compared_to_limit" trigger. For example, "demesne_size_compared_to_limit < 0.5" will check if someone is below 50% of their demesne limit
- Added "multiplicative_trade_post_income_modifier" holding modifier
- Added "can_create_empires" government parameter (can_create_kingdoms already exists)
- Added "extra_ai_eval_troops" title parameter. See 00_landed_titles.info for documentation
- Added "relative_realm_size" trigger. For example, relative_realm_size = { who = liege size > 0.2 } checks that your realm size is at least 20% of your liege's
- Strings that are too long (above 1023 characters) will no longer crash the game, though they should still be avoided as they simply don't work beyond 1023 characters. This should also solve crashes involving mismatched quote signs
- Strings that are too long now get logged in error.log
- The game will no longer crash if more than 32767 flags (E.G., set_character_flag) are used. New limit is 2^32, which you will run out of memory long before reaching
- Using export_to_variable on a dead character will no longer crash the game
- has_coa_on_barony_only can now be set to yes/no on individual religions rather than just groups. This will override whatever has been set for the group
- The "give_title" console command now gives more feedback if something is wrong with the parameters
- Absolutely all tooltips now support custom loc. Generally, "Root" will be the player
- Most text directly related to religion (E.G., religion name, description, holy war name) now provide the religion itself for custom loc purposes
- Added a "RelHead" promotion for religion loc, meaning you can now for example name a religion "Cult of [RelHead.GetFirstName]"
- Added optional generate_tooltip parameter for hidden effects. If set to "no", the game won't generate the tooltip at all. Note that if event targets are set in the hidden effect, this will break them in tooltips. It may also break randomization, so only ever use it if you have a really compelling reason to do so
- Added 'add_modifier' and 'remove_modifier' console commands (for Character Modifiers.)
- Added 'decision' console command, which ignores the trigger conditions
- Stewardship no longer applies a debuff when below 5; 0 is its baseline now like all the other stats
- Added 'realm_levies_plus_allies' as an exportable value for the 'export_to_variable' effect.
- Added a Define for Looter army maintenance cost (LOOTER_ARMY_MAINT_MULT)
- random_list chances below 1% but above 0% will now use 2 decimals rather than 0
- The game will now log invalid tributary relationships in history (E.G., someone being a tributary of a title with no holder)
- Fixed looting for raiding adventurers not of a religion/culture/government that allows raiding not working
- If the flag "always_show_in_marriage_selection" is set on a character, they will bypass most conditions to be shown in the marriage selection view. Note that this does *not* allow otherwise illegal marriages, just ensures they show up in the listing
- Fixed observing unplayable characters instantly booting you back to regular observe mode
- headgear_that_hides_hair now bases itself on the portraitType of the headgear rather than the character. This means that if someone changes culture and thus gets headgear that should hide their hair, it actually will
- OR and AND triggers now don't show "all/one of the following..." if there's only a single trigger within them
- Fixed it being possible for landed title adjectives in some edge cases ending up empty
- Added the old religion to FROM scope 'in on_county_religion_change'
- Added trigger 'had_artifact_flag'
- Added trigger 'artifact' (to compare two artifact scopes)
- Added trigger 'climate'
- Fixed the "completely_controls" trigger not considering empty non-wasteland provinces
- Fixed scoping to event targets in effects not being properly localised, thus showing just a colon with no name before it
- Added "ai_check_interval" parameter for decisions. This determines how rarely the AI checks a given decision, and can be useful for performance-heavy decisions that don't need to be checked often. See 00_decisions.info for documentation
- Added a "shares_realm_border_with" trigger. Checks if any province in your realm (everything under your titles) borders any province in their realm
- Added COALITION_THREAT_MAX_DISTANCE define. Independent AIs will consider independent rulers within this range to be threats if they're strong enough (COALITION_SCARY_TROOP_STRENGTH_THREAT_RATIO)
- "Added COURTIER_EVENT_PROCESS_OFFSET define, which determines how often courtiers check MTTH events. Set to 50, as compared to 20 for rulers". This changelog entry from 2.7 now actually has an effect
- Added num_of_society_members trigger. Scope must be a character or society. Returns true if the society has at least this many members. Also supports <, <=, ==, and >=
- A lot of error messages that previously only showed in the internal beta .exe now get logged at all times
- Added "hire_range" parameter for mercenary titles. If set, this overrides the MERCENARY_HIRE_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD define for that specific mercenary
- Added "can_demand_religious_conversion" government parameter. Decides whether people with the government can use the Demand Religious Conversion interaction. Defaults to yes
- create_character now supports "dynasty = actually_culture" which picks a random dynasty name from the culture if there's no unused static dynasty to use, rather than just resorting to a random holding in the world (what "dynasty = culture" does)
- Now possible to scope to timed modifiers in localisation. For example, if ROOT is a character, [Root.modifier_name.GetExpiryDate] would show the expiry date of the modifier. If no such modifier is present, nothing gets shown. Also supports "GetName"
- random_direct_de_jure_vassal_title now exists. Works like any_direct_de_jure_vassal_title, except picks one at random
- Fixed start_date and current_date checking that the days are equal rather than equal or greater
- All numerical triggers now support comparison operators (>=, <=, <, >, and ==) with a few exceptions: tier triggers, among_most_powerful_vassals. These exceptions are due to operation triggers breaking existing behavior (E.G., "tier = duke" isn't equivalent to "tier >= duke", which the comparison operators assume)
- Added "unsafe_destroy_artifact" effect, which can destroy indestructible artifacts
- Artifact localisation (E.G., name and desc) now provides the artifact as From
- The artifact activation and gift triggers now provide the artifact as From
- Added support for "else_if" and "else". If one of these is placed after an "if" or "else_if", it will be executed if the "if"/"else_if" limit returns false. Example:
	if = { limit = { something = yes } do_something = yes }
	else_if = { limit = { something_else = yes } do_something_else = yes }
	else = { do_another_thing = yes }
- Added trigger "artifact_can_be_gifted_to = ROOT", which checks if the artifact currently scoped to can be gifted to the target character
- Now possible to specify "sound = no" for death reasons, which will prevent killing someone with that reason causing a death sound
- Fixed FROMFROM (the holding title) not always being available in the building trigger
- Fixed whatever character is FROM getting included in event option portrait lists if you scope to something that isn't a character
- Improved the error messages for the reload_texture command, and made it more forgiving when it comes to "/" vs. "\\" and ".dds" vs. ".tga". Also fixed it in some cases crashing. Generally, simply copying the path specified in the .gfx file should work
- Added COST_COMBAT_RATING define for specifying the cost of combat rating in the ruler designer
- Added unsafe_impregnate and unsafe_impregnate_cuckoo effects. These can impregnate someone who is already pregnant, while the two old effects are no longer able to do so
- Added a fail_trigger_effect field for events. This effect is triggered if script attempts to trigger an event, but the trigger isn't fulfilled. Useful for handling things like one character in a chain dying for unrelated reasons partway through the chain
- Fixed not all parts of the society rank tooltip having the appropriate scopes set
- spawn_unit can now take "province = closest_to_capital", which will spawn as close to the character's capital as possible
- The "debug_mode" console command (AKA "charinfo") will now also show extra information about titles
- The hardcoded opinion penalty for being imprisoned now references "opinion_imprisoned" rather than "opinion_arrest_attempt"
- The "damage_unit" effect can now take negative numbers in order to heal units instead
- Added "is_artifact_equipped" trigger, which can be used in an artifact scope
- Insults and compliments now provide the giver and receiver in localisation. The giver is FROM, while the receiver is ROOT
- The game will now log titles and provinces for which no localisation exists
- The "set_name" effect now works on artifacts (before only worked on characters, titles, and provinces)
- The "set_name" effect can now take a scope of the same type as the thing being renamed. E.G., if you're renaming a character, "set_name = ROOT" will work if ROOT is also a character, and take their name. Note that for artifacts this will use the name *after* processing localisation, so all custom loc will become static upon doing so
- Custom loc is now resolved when using the "set_name" effect, so something like 'set_name = "[This.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]"' will work
- Fixed resetting title names with "set_name" not causing it to take its cultural name
- The "create_title" effect can now take "short_name = yes". This will suppress "Empire of" and similar from the name of the title, just like it does when defining a static landed title
- Added define SEND_ARTIFACT_GREED_MULT
- If you set the character flag "no_court_invites" on someone, they now become impossible to invite to court. Useful for characters you want to ensure stay in a specific court
- Added on actions on_eu4_conversion_start and on_eu4_conversion_done. Can be used to prepare the gamestate for EU4 conversion, then restore the original state
- Added on_tyranny_gained and on_tyranny_gained_tyrant_only on-actions
- When debug_mode (AKA charinfo) is active, hovering over an event will now provide a list of all event targets set, and what each scope corresponds to
- Added "log_scopes" effect, which records the above information in game.log. Like the "log" effect, only logs if the game is started with the "-scriptlog" parameter
- Added "GetScopes" property for scopes in loc. This will show the same info as "log_scopes". Note that it only works in scopes; once you've promoted to a specific entity (E.G., a character), scope properties are unavailable
- Fixed the war scope not always being available in CB script when you'd expect it to be (E.G., after scoping to "ROOT")
- Fixed negative society currency gains not showing up in the gain tooltip
- Added the following relation triggers:
	is_parent_of = ROOT
	is_cousin_of = ROOT
	is_aunt_uncle_of = ROOT
	is_nibling_of = ROOT - Checks niece/nephew
	is_grandparent_of = ROOT
	is_grandchild_of = ROOT
	is_descendant_of = ROOT - Checks if the scoped character descends from the ROOT. No limit on how far removed. Expensive, so use with care. Limited to 16 generations of removal for performance reasons
	is_ancestor_of = ROOT - Checks if ROOT descends from the scoped character. No limit on how far removed. Expensive, so use with care. Limited to 16 generations of removal for performance reasons
- set_preferred_capital now works on static titles as well, not just dynamic ones
- Added "capital" title history effect, which sets the preferred capital of the title
- "show_portrait" can now take a scope or similar. E.G., "show_portrait = ROOT" will show ROOT, while "show_portrait = offmap_china" will show the emperor of China. The right-hand-side can be a scope, a title, or an offmap power
- Added a "portrait" parameter to events, which determines which character is shown in the upper-right corner. For example "portrait = offmap_china" will cause the Chinese Emperor to be shown
- Added trade_route_control trigger. Example:
	trade_route_control = {
		trade_route = silk_road        # What trade route to check against
		value > 0.1                    # What percentage needs to be owned. Takes comparison operators
		type = trade_post_locations    # What to compare. Takes wealth, provinces, trade_posts, and trade_post_locations. The latter two are restricted by the trade post trigger in the trade route definition. Defaults to wealth if not set
		indirectly_owned = no          # Whether to include provinces in one's sub-realm that are owned by vassals. Defaults to yes if not set
	}
- Added alias for vassal_or_below trigger called liege_or_above_of.
- Added alias for liege_or_above trigger called vassal_or_below_of.
- Added decision filters independent_rulers and independent_rulers_including_me
- Added decision filter close_relatives. Includes children, grandchildren, parents, siblings, and niblings
- The "female" paramenter in create_character can now take "random" or a number between 0 and 100 in order to get a random chance of the person being a woman. E.G., "female = 42"
- Added any_pupil and random_pupil scopes. Scopes to characters you're educating
- monthly_character_prestige and liege_prestige (and the piety versions) now work for forts and trade posts as well
- Forts and trade posts can now give tech spread bonuses
- pdx_tooltip and pdx_tooltip_delayed now work in far more places than before
- Fixed religious names not checking the cultural base name in create_character, unlike character birth
- Fixed the spouses of characters who don't get their title (E.G., "Count") in their name getting the title in their name
- Virtually anything that works as a scope on the left-hand-side (E.G., "educator = {") now works as a scope on the right-hand-side (E.G., "= educator") for triggers and effects that support more than just relative scoping (ROOT, FROM, etc. and event targets)
- Now possible to scope to religions, cultures, and their groups. E.G., "norse = {". Note that for the groups, this simply scopes to the first culture/religion in the group, not the actual group itself
- Added "can_use_cb" trigger, which checks everything in the CB itself, plus the extra hardcoded restrictions on regular war declarations. Basically, checks if the war would show up and be usable from the UI. Example:
	can_use_cb = {
		target = d_mecklemburg				# What character to target. Can also take titles
		casus_belli = religious				# What CB to use
		thirdparty_title = d_mecklemburg	# What title to target, if relevant
		#thirdparty = FROM					# What character to declare on the behalf of, if relevant
	}
- Ensured that effects work even if some of the systems they rely on haven't loaded yet when they're first read. This was already the case for triggers
- Added is_or_was_offmap_power_ruler trigger
- Fixed a bunch of decision related triggers having their tooltip logic inverted (E.G., saying "Can NOT take decision" when it should say "Can take decision")
- Added parameters attacker_unoccupied_warscore and defender_unoccupied_warscore. See 00_cb_types.txt for documentation
- Fixed plot start date not being saved, meaning that the "plot_months" trigger would be wrong after saving and loading
- Fixed the destroy_artifact effect causing the game to crash on launch if used somewhere where the artifact database has yet to be initialized
- Diplomatic interaction on-action events now provide the starting scope (normally, the actor) as FROMFROM so that you have a way to get back to the actor after scoping to someone else
- The "while" effect now supports the "count" parameter, which determines how many times it loops. E.G., "count = 10" means it will loop until the limit is no longer met, or it has been executed 10 times, whichever happens first
- Fixed scope changes sometimes resulting in improper seeding. E.G., if you scoped to FROM inside any_realm_title, any randomness would be identical
- Fixed casus belli effect execution not being seeded, so the same randomness would always occur if conditions were similar enough
- Fixed the "is_lowborn" trigger checking the opposite of what it should; "is_lowborn = yes" used to check that you're part of a dynasty rather than not part of one
- Added any_tributary and random_tributary scopes
- Added player_heir scope, which scopes to the character shown on your character sheet rather than whoever is heir to your primary title
- The on_war_ended on-actions now provide the war in question, meaing that war triggers and effects like "using_cb" and "any_attacker" will work, similarly to how they work in CBs
- create_title will now pick a color at random if there's no base title, rather than always making the map color white
- Added set_description effect, which changes the description of an artifact to the given string/loc key
- Added can_inherit government parameter. Defaults to yes. If set to no, characters with this government cannot inherit titles
- The following opinion modifiers now work in all modifiers: rel_head_opinion, child_opinion, dynasty_opinion, female_dynasty_opinion, male_dynasty_opinion
- In effect fields custom_tooltip will now always properly hide the tooltip of nested effects.
- Added "window" attribute for events, which specifies the name of a GUI window to use, meaning an event can be given virtually any look. Specifying the "background" parameter will also apply that GFX name + "_option" to the option buttons if GFX by that name exists
- Fixed clear_delayed_event not working on provinces if the event in question is a narrative_event or similar rather than explicitly a province event
- Having fewer than 7 baronies defined for a county should no longer risk crashing the game
- Added max_attacker_battle_score and max_defender_battle_score CB parameters, which override the relevant define if set
- The "government" trigger can now also take a scope as its right-hand-side. E.G., "government = ROOT" or "government = k_norway". It will compare to the government of the character the scope corresponds to
- Added capturing_defender_is_complete_victory and capturing_attacker_is_complete_victory CB parameters. Default to "yes". If set to "no", capturing the defender/attacker is not automatic victory, but instead gives CAPTURED_HEIR_WAR_SCORE warscore
- Added "display_on_map" parameter to job actions, which can be used to override the color of the job action when assigning it, and providing a tooltip, based on a trigger. As many such sections can be added as desired; the first that evaluates to true will be used. If none are defined, or if none evaluate true, the default green color is used. The special colors are only used if the job action itself can be used. The tooltip will be run through custom loc with the same scopes as the trigger. Example:
	display_on_map = {
		tooltip = JOB_PROSELYTIZE_DIFFERENT_RELIGION  # Key of the loc to add to the tooltip
		trigger = {                                   # Trigger for when this should happen. Same scopes as the allow/potential for the job action itself
			NOT = { religion = FROM }
		}
		color = { 255 0 0 }                           # What color to use on the map
	}
- Added logging at game start if there are living characters who lack a culture or religion
- Fixed not all event targets working with custom loc (E.G., artifacts)
- All notifications now have custom loc scope available. Those that didn't use to now have FROM as the "sender" of the notification, and ROOT as the player
- Added government parameters can_grant_kingdoms_and_empires_to_other_government_group and can_be_granted_kingdoms_and_empires_by_other_government_group for governments. Changed the defaults so that by default governments can grant within a group, and receive from anyone
- Added AI flags "ai_flag_refuse_marriage" and "ai_flag_refuse_concubinage". If set, the AI will never marry the character off or accept them being made into a concubine, except if they're the person the character is getting married to/made consort of
- Added logging for buildings that are built while their pre-requisites or the building they upgrade from is missing
- Added artifact_age and has_known_creation_date triggers
- Added set_looter_hostility_days effect, which can be used to force a specific time of looter hostility, including 0 in order to remove looter hostility
- Added "debug_events" console command. After running this, the game will keep track of how many times each event has fired. This can be printed to the game folder (wherever the CK2 .exe is) using "debug_dumpevents"
- Fixed scoping in custom loc working very inconsistently with script scoping at times. Most importantly, this means that "Root" will no longer be undefined after scoping to something else, so something like "From.GetRootRelation" should now always work
- Fixed indentation in random_list tooltips not working properly if there's more than one effect within a single entry
- Fixed provinces getting duplicate or no names in cases where "external" provinces are defined in any spot other than dead last in the province list
- If you disable the prestige hit from unlanded sons for a tier, that tier will no longer get the unlanded sons alert
- Fixed scoping to job titles looking really ugly in tooltips
- Made the error messages when wrong names are used for a number of effects and triggers easier to understand
- Fixed it being possible to accidentally make everyone in the world allied when using add_alliance
- Added logging when you in history put a date entry within another date entry, since this is invalid and won't work. Can also help detect malformed script in some cases
- Fixed portraits not showing up in trigger switches
- Ensured that a fake war exists for tooltip purposes before declaring a war, so you can scope to the attacker and defender in the tooltips
- Fixed the graphical_culture trigger crashing the game if an invalid graphical culture was used
- Added effect_even_if_dead history effect for characters. Will be run even after the character's death, unlike "effect"
- Fixed the "new_character" scope in some cases not persisting when saving and reloading
- Fixed missing newline at end of destroy_tradepost, destroy_fort, and destroy_hospital effect
- random_list entries below 0 due to modifiers are now simply counted as 0 rather than a negative number
- Fixed it being possible for the artifact name in the "Gift Artifact" interaction to go out of bounds for very long artifact names
- Including a mesh that doesn't exist in a .GFX file should no longer crash the game. Means that for example reapers_due_dlc.gfx can be modded without crashing the game for users without The Reaper's Due
- The opening text for diplomatic events now supports custom loc, with Root being the receiver and From being the sender
- Ensured no longer possible governments cannot persist for more than a month after invalidation (E.G., due to changed culture)
- set_government_type now forces immediate government validation after setting the government. This essentially means the character must meet the potential for the government you set
- Tech point bonuses now work in all holding types, not just normal holdings and hospitals
- The "is_married" pre-trigger now only returns true if the character has a living spouse. Before also returned true if spouse was dead
- The game will no longer log errors about missing images or sounds for events disabled due to lack of DLC

- Fixed the "trade_route" trigger having no localisation
- Added "assassination_interaction_trigger" scripted trigger for the Assassinate diplomatic action
- Fixed diplomatic responses in some cases showing you rather than the person responding to you
- Made it clear that rulers without a scripted dynasty will get one generated at gamestart. Now has "Unknown" dynasty rather than "Lowborn" on the campaign startup screen
- Fixed income from tributaries not counting towards "yearly_income" triggers and similar
- Fixed using export_to_variable not working on global and local variables
- The "capital" character history effect now actually works to set a character's capital. Before it had no effect
- Fixed the on-start capital validation overriding the current capital for people who don't have a preferred capital
- Fixed force_host normally resulting in the host simply resetting to one's liege/own court a day later
- The secret_religious_cult scope now works even if the character does not have a secret religion; it'll now always refer to their true religion instead (secret religion if they have one, otherwise public religion)
- Added could_be_parent_of trigger, which checks if the scoped character is in the right age range to be the parent of the target character. This means that they're at least AGE_OF_MARRIAGE_MALE years older, and at most MAX_CHILD_BIRTH_AGE years older if female (for immortal characters, as long as they became immortal before this age they bypass the check). It also checks that they didn't die before the birth date of the target
- Fixed a number of scopes (one example: the target of factions) being unlocalized
- Fixed a missing linebreak in the betrothal and marriage interaction tooltips
- Fixed broken betrothals appearing as marriages on the character screen until the screen is refreshed. Now the character listing disappears entirely

- Fixed nomad titles that should be dynastically named not being so on the character selection screen, instead changing names once the campaign starts
- Ensured custom loc referenced from hardcoded loc properties (E.G., GetPlayerRelation) get processed
- Ensured custom loc works in the tooltip for dead characters
- Added on-actions on_revoke_attempted_started_war, on_retract_vassal_attempted_started_war, on_absorb_clan_attempted_started_war, and on_split_clan_attempted_started_war
- Added join_crusade_if_bordering_hostile parameter for religions. If set to yes, the AI won't refrain from joining a crusade simply because it borders a heathen/heretic realm

# User modding
###################
- Fixed the game failing to find government unique title names at times. Now it'll never return the default name if a non-default one is defined. It now also tries without the tier string before it tries without the government string, so if you were to define "city_title" and "king_title", the former will be used
- "add_law" can now take parameters: "cooldown" and "opinion_effect". "cooldown" simply works as a way to specify that there's no cooldown, like add_law_w_cooldown does. "opinion_effect" can be used to specify that the opinion effect of passing the law shouldn't be applied. E.G., the anger/happiness at succession law changes, or at tribal organization changes. Existing script still works as before. Example of new syntax:
	add_law = {
		law = true_cognatic_succession
		cooldown = no
		opinion_effect = no
	}
- Messed up localisation is now less likely to crash the game
- FROM in on_character_convert_religion and on_character_convert_culture is no longer a temp character, but instead the culture/religion itself. This only provides access to comparing to the culture/religion (or group). It should also still work to set cultures/religions and such. Please report any issues encountered with it. This change also means that it should now be possible to reference the previous characters outside "immediate" and similar without the game crashing
- same_society_as trigger will no longer be true when both characters are not part of a society.
- Added the command line argument -scriptlog to enable log triggers and effects without enabling script asserts.
- Added artifact backgrounds (arti_bg.dds, arti_bg_glow.dds, arti_bg_small.dds, and arti_bg_glow_small.dds) to gfx/inventory/artifacts to make it easier for modders to make their own artifacts that follow the style of the vanilla artifacts
- Added society icon backgrounds (society_symbol_bg_stone.dds and society_symbol_bg_wood.dds) to gfx/inventory/societies to make it easier for modders to make their own societies that follow the style of the vanilla societies
- Added a better secret religion system, now based around a code attribute rather than traits. Characters can have up to one secret religion. If the character ends up as their secret religion, their secret religion is cleared. This can be set and accessed via script:
	- Added triggers "secret_religion", "true_religion", "secret_religion_group", and "true_religion_group". True religion being defined as your secret religion if you have one, otherwise your public religion
	- The religion triggers (religion, secret_religion, true_religion, and the group versions) can now optionally take a "target_type" determining which religion of the target they check against. E.G., religion = { target = ROOT target_type = secret } will check if the scoped character's public religion is the same as ROOT's private religion. The valid types are "public", "secret", and "true". The default is to use the same as the type being checked; religion default to public, secret_religion to secret, true_religion to true. A religion (group) name as the right-hand-side works for all the triggers
	- Effect set_secret_religion takes a religion or a scope. It optionally takes a target type (true/secret/public), but defaults to secret
	- Added trigger has_secret_religion which takes "yes" or "no"
	- Added set_secret_religion and clear_secret_religion effects
	- The "religion" and "set_secret_religion" effects optionally take a religion type (true/secret/public) to determine which to use when a scope is referenced. "religion" defaults to public, while "set_secret_religion" defaults to "secret"
	- Added "secret_religion" console command that sets a character's secret religion. Defaults to the player's character
	- Who can see a character's secret religion is defined in 00_religions.txt
	- Added a can_see_secret_religion trigger. Takes a scope, and checks if the character scope you're currently in can see the target character's secret religion
	- Societies can now have an associated religion, which is accessible from script in the same way as character or province religion, including on the right-hand-side of triggers and effects. This is scripted with for example "associated_religion = catholic". It has no effect beyond being accessible via script
	- Added a convert_to_secret_religion effect. Takes "yes" or a character scope. Sets your public religion to your secret religion, or the target character's secret religion if a scope is used
	- Added a on_character_convert_secret_religion on_action
	- Added SecretReligion and TrueReligion localisation promotions so that [This.SecretReligion.GetName] and similar work
- Added a dynamic secret religious society system that significantly reduces the work involved in making a religious cult society
	- All religions except those specifically excluded get a secret religious society generated. The attributes of this society is defined by a template in 00_societies.txt
	- Most the sections in society definitions now provide the society itself as a scope (FROM)
	- Societies can now have an associated religion (defined with associated_religion = religiontag). This means that scopes can now be used where religons could be used, such as the right-hand-side of the "religion" trigger or effect. It also means that the "religion" trigger and similar can be used within a society scope
	- Added a secret_religious_cult scope, which will scope to the cult associated with the character's secret religion. Also works in religion and province scopes. This can also be used on the right-hand-side of effects and triggers
	- is_rank_full can now take a society scope rather than just a society name
	- Added a "secret_religion" history effect
- Added an on_artifact_inheritance on_action
- Scope: ROOT is the character, FROM is the artifact, FROMFROM is the old holder
- Fixed bugs in artifact_owner and original_artifact_owner scope changes
- Added tooltips for artifact_owner and original_artifact_owner scope changes
- Added "owner" and "original_owner" as valid scope changes for artifacts
- Added on_society_created and on_society_destroyed on_actions
- Fixed scoping to saved society and artifact event targets not working
- Added religion_scope, secret_religion_scope, true_religion_scope, and culture_scope as scopes. These scope to the religion/culture of the character/province/society (only religion for societies) currently scoped to. Can be saved as event targets
- Added a save_conversion folder in "common" which handles convering obsolete objects in saves. Currently handles religions and societies
- Added a clear_flags_with_prefix effect. Works in character, province, title, and artifact scopes
- Fixed the society rank tooltip not having FROM defined. FROM is now the society grand master, as with other society tooltips
- Fixed troops spawned to unlanded characters not getting any tech bonus. They now get the tech from the province they spawned in. If a "home" province is defined, they'll use that province's tech instead
- Added "fallback_text" for custom loc. If none of the triggered texts return true, this will be used instead if defined. The fallback text cannot have a trigger, and only one can exist
- Fixed the error log complaining if you use "set_mother = 0"
- Added is_interested_in_any_society = <yes/no> trigger. It evaluates if you're currently showing interest in a society or not.
- Society.GetName, Society.GetNameCap, and Society.GetCurrency now fall back to null_society and null_society_currency rather than just ending up blank
- Fixed the "has_artifact" condition showing up blank
- Fixed the game crashing in some cases after resigning and reloading, and hovering over a port that had a fleet in it when you resigned
- Fixed reverse_religion not working in some cases. Only affected the 2.7.1 beta
- Restored the behavior where "culture_group = something_that_doesnt_exist" always returns false. Only affected the 2.7.1 beta
- Ensured "portrait_society = something_that_doesnt_exist" always returns false
- Trade posts in-land now use the actual height of the terrain for the camp and flag rather than just the flag. If you mod positions.txt, you'll likely want to set the height offset for all "ports" to 0

- Fixed the logic for the AI being willing to move to your court based on you being able to press their claim(s) sometimes being wrong

###################
- Revised Black Death & Epidemic Mechanics
  - The Black Death is now a major world event with devastating consequences!
    - There are many different Black Death outbreak scenarios, both fictional and historical (controlled via the Game Rules feature).
    - Widespread plague might trigger an Epidemic Blame Game!
      - Your peasantry demands blood! Will you blame the Witches, Jews or Cats - or simply ignore the peasant rabble?
    - The aftermath of a major plague might result in your peasants claiming this is the End of Days!
    - After the initial outbreak, the Black Death might become endemic and sporadically return.
  - A plague banner will appear if the world is suffering from the Black Plague or if a minor Epidemic is in your realm, clicking it will bring you to the Epidemic Map Mode.
    - Hover the banner to see the epidemics currently ravaging the world!
    - The new mapmode shows the coverage and spread of Epidemics across the map!
  - Minor Epidemics (I.e. Slow Fever or Consumption) are more frequent and spread in a more logical manner.
    - Minor Epidemics might have Minor, Normal or Major outbreaks.
  - Provinces infected by epidemics, especially the Black Death, might become Depopulated.
    - Depopulated provinces carry many penalties, such as tax, levy and supply limit, but are easier to convert!
  - Disease and Depopulation will have accompanying aesthetics:
    - Plague graphics; ravens and rats, peasants stacking or burning corpses, and even a grim reaper if things are really dire!
    - Plague audio; from occasional coughing to hordes of wailing peasants!
  - Chronicle entries for plague outbreaks and regions being depopulated.

- Seclusion Decision
  - Characters may go into Seclusion when an epidemic threatens, shutting their capital holding off from the world. In seclusion characters are safe from the disease outside, as long as no one inside is already infected...
  - Secluded characters will be marked by a portcullis icon on their portrait.
  - When in Seclusion, contact with the outside world is limited.
  - Special Seclusion events will trigger for secluded courts, i.e. starvation.
  - A ruler can at any time open the gates and go out of seclusion, doing this too early might have consequences...

- Hospitals
  - Hospitals are a new type of holding that can be accessed and built in the Extended Province View.
  - Hospitals protect against Epidemics, and help alleviate the effects of Depopulation.
  - There are several types of buildings that can be constructed in the Hospital holding, i.e. Leper Colonies, providing various benefits.
  - An icon in the Province view will show the current 'Hospital Level' of a province, and the benefits of having them.
  - You may ask the leader of a holy order of your faith to build a hospital in your capital in exchange for permission to build a castle there too.

- Prosperity
  - Provinces who are not Depopulated will eventually start to Prosper!
  - Prosperity can increase in three levels, providing more benefit for each level.
  - Prosperity ticks up over time, but is decreased by disease, bad governance and war.
    - Random events may increase prosperity of specific provinces.
    - Bringing back loot as a raider will increase prosperity.
  - A new ambition has been added that allows a peaceful ruler to increase the prosperity of their realm.
  - Prosperity increases the tax and levy regain rate of a province, while also reducing the revolt risk.
  - Prospering provinces are more likely to attract Epidemics.
  - Each independent realm of the rank Duke or above, as well as larger vassals, may set a province as their Crown Focus!
    - The Crown Focus province will prosper quicker!
    - If the Crown Focus province has the highest level of prosperity special events may trigger giving permanent rewards, i.e. province modifiers giving bonuses and extra holding slots!
    - Your Crown Focus is marked with a 3D crown icon on the map for easy reference!

- Revised Maimed Traits
  - Characters no longer just get 'Maimed', there is now an entire category of maimed traits!
  - When you're maimed you now either become One-Eyed, One-Handed, One-Legged, Disfigured or Mangled.
    - One-Eyed and Disfigured characters will have new on-portrait graphics! Sport eyepatches, broken eyes, silver masks and other ornate facial coverings.
  - When Maimed you gain a temporary trait, 'Severely Wounded', which will heal over time.
  - Severe Wounds can develop into full-blown infections.
  - Trait-specific flavor events, host a masquerade ball, become ambidextrous, or many others!

- New Character Disease System
  - Gone are the days of simply becoming 'Ill', diseases now come in many flavors!
  - Before manifesting a disease you will now gain up to three Symptoms, symptoms can also be harmless products of paranoia.
    - Headaches, Fevers, Chest Pains, Diarrhea and many more!
  - Diseases are more varied and, in general, more deadly!
    - New diseases include the Flu, Gout, Dystentery, Rabies, Cancer and Food Poisoning.
    - Characters with Leprosy will become disfigured over time.
    - Spend enough time at sea and you might contract Scurvy!

- Court Physician
  - In order to protect yourself from Disease, you can now employ a Court Physician!
  - Court Physicians will attempt to diagnose any symptoms you have in order to treat your disease more effectivley.
  - Court Physicians provide various types of treatment for diseases, ranging from cautious to experimental and even mystical!
  - Court Physicians will, in addition to treating you, treat anyone in your court.
    - Choose to reward a Physician for a job well done, or punish them for failing in treating your friends and relatives.
  - A new decision allows you to scour the realm to find a Court Physician, though beware of quacks...
  - Plenty of new flavor events tied to the Court Physician.

- Prisoner Interactions
  - Depraved rulers can now choose to Torture or Mutilate their prisoners.
  - You can choose to Publicly Humiliate your foes to sap their prestige.
  - When executing a prisoner you will no longer just 'execute' them, instead a culturally appropriate execution method will be chosen! A few new methods include:
    - Burning heretics and witches at the stake.
    - Carving your enemies into Blood Eagles.
    - Impaling your victims.
    - Crushing prisoners with Elephants in India!
    - And many, many more!
