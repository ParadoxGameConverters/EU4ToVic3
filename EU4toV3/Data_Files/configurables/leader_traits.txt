# General/Admiral conversion rules

## The sum of Fire and Shock is summoned as "offense"
## Maneuver is summoned as "maneuver", Siege as "siege"
# 
# All four values (fire, shock, maneuver, siege) are read from the EU4 file.
# The rules here set MINIMUM CONDITIONS for each (enabled) personality and background.
# The special value "other" consists of the sum of all unnamed values
# so if a personality specifies "fire" and "other", "other" means "shock + maneuver + siege".
# 
# The first rule that matches is selected, so the better/more restrictive rules should be near the top of each section.
# If some traits are not desired for conversion, simply omit them from the file.
# Default rules are chosen to generally result in POSITIVE traits

# Syntax: link = { trait = [vic3_trait] additional = [yes/no] [admiral/explorer] = [yes/no] [value] = [num] }
# Additional is understood to be at no if not expressed
# It is used in cases a trait should be given, but another one should also be granted according to following rules to the same character
