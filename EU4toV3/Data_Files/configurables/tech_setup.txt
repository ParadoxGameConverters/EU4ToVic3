# Technologies are assigned reverse median values; from 0 (everyone has them) to 100 
# (only one nation has it). Score 50 means half the nations will have this tech.
#
# This is based on vanilla tier distribution (1->7): 5|48|41|83|30|51|55 = 313 total, distributed:
# T1  |T2   |T3   |T4   |T5  |T6   |T7
# 1.6%|15.3%|13.1%|26.5%|9.6%|16.3%|17.6%
# 98  |83   |70   |43   |33  |17   |0

# Techs within "same tier" are sorted so that ones with prereqs from the same tier come
# earlier (line_infantry 61 -> army reserves 70). Also, artistic licence.
