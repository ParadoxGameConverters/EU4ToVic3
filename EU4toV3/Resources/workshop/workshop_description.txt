[h1]EU4 To Vic3 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the EU4 to Vic3 Converter project! The goal of this project is to allow a Europa Universalis 4 campaign to be transferred and continued in Victoria 3, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 1444 to 1936, and further using our other converters from Crusader Kings 3 and to Hearts of Iron 4.

Running a continuous campaign from Imperator or Crusader Kings all the way to Hearts of Iron is called running a [b]mega-campaign[/b].

[h2]The converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i] (program, software)[/h2]
[list]
[*] Converter currently supports EU4 1.31 and Victoria 3 1.0. EU4 DLCs are optional, Vic3 DLCs are optional.
[*] This mod is not intended to be enabled in game. It is only a [i]delivery vehicle[/i] for the converter's download link.
[*] You can also download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/eu4-to-vic3-converter-thread.1475054/]Paradox forum thread[/url] or from Github.
[/list]

[h3]Setting up the converter.[/h3]
To set up the converter, you’ll need to follow the steps below:
[olist]
[*] Subscribe to the this mod.
[*] If the mod does not immediately begin downloading, you may need to start EU4 launcher to trigger the download.
[*] Go to your mod folder (usually [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\workshop\content\<INSERTHEREGAME>\<INSERTMOD>[/i], or elsewhere if you moved your steam library)
[*] Inside it find and open [i]downloadLink.txt[/i]. 
[*] Within that file is a direct link to the converter's download location. Copy the link and paste it into a browser to download it.
[*] Unzip the downloaded converter to a new folder by right-clicking on it and selecting [i]Extract All…[/i]
[*] Finally, go to the extracted converter's directory and fire it up by running [i]ConverterFrontend.exe[/i].
[/olist]

If you downloaded the converter directly from forums or github, you only need to execute steps 6 and 7.

[h2]How does it work?[/h2]
Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis_IV_to_Victoria_3_Converter]wiki page[/url].
Very generally, it takes your Europa Universalis 4 [b]saved game[/b] and converts it into a Victoria 3 [b]mod[/b].
You then have to [b]enable that mod[/b] when starting Vic3 launcher:

[olist]
[*] Create a new playset in the launcher.
[*] Add the conversion mod into the new playset, along with other mods you want to use (such as graphical ones)
[*] On the Home page of the launcher, make sure the new playset is enabled and selected before pressing Play.
[/olist]

[h2]Troubleshooting[/h2] 

We welcome any questions and will gladly help you out if you hit a problem. 

When seeking help, discussing conversion issues or problems, or if you simply need answers to your questions, come to our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/eu4-to-vic3-converter-thread.1475054/]Paradox forum thread[/url].

To resolve issues we will always need your conversion's [i][b]log.txt[/b][/i]. You can find it in your converter's folder after conversion. Upload your log.txt to the release thread, along with a detailed description of your problem. We may need additional data like your running savegame or mods used, which you can also upload to the forums directly.

Keep in mind Steam discussion below is [b]not suited[/b] to troubleshooting as you cannot upload files we need.
