# This file primarily focuses on iffy eu4 mechanic of culture-swapping entire cultures into new culture groups.
# Example: When Russia unites all slavic countries, game swaps every slavic culture with a "xy_new" variant culture - which we map to regular
# cultures anyway (Polish remains Polish), however we do need to edit the traits of the Polish culture to reflect this trait,
# thus it stops being western slavic and becomes eastern/general slavic.
#
# When no provinces of polish_new are found in the save, such swap will not occur. Same goes for everything else listed below.
#
# culture = xxx				eu4 cultures to check the presence of
# addtradition = xxx		tradition traits to be added to mapped culture if target is found
# removetradition = xxx		tradition traits to be remove from mapped culture if target is found
# replaceheritage = xxx		heritage trait to be set to mapped culture if target is found
# replacelanguage = xxx		language trait to be set to mapped culture if target is found


# Testing
link = { culture = culture3 addtradition = testaddedtrait removetradition = testtrait2 replacelanguage = new_language replaceheritage = new_heritage }
