# Decide how ownership will be split among Vic 3 buildings.
# Keywords are 'local', 'national', 'national_service', 'building_manor_house', 'building_financial_district'
# colonial = 0.2 ### This shifts 20% of the aristocracy too be owned by an overlord if applicable; default is 0%
# financial = 0.1 ### This shifts 10% of the capital to the nation's capital; default is 0%
# recognized = yes ### This prevents capitalists from owning these buildings if a nation is unrecognized
