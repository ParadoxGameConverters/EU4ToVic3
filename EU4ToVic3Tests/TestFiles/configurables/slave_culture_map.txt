## Slave generation
# For countries whose primary culture has a listed Vic3 master culture trait, all slaves in it will be re-assigned another culture
# Usage:
# link = { master = [culture trait] slave = [culture] }
# If a master culture has no slave culture defined, slaves will be of the same culture as master ones
# The calculation is done BEFORE colonial culture dynamic generation

link = { master = anglophone slave = afro_american }
link = { master = celtic_people slave = afro_american }
#link = { master = anglophone master = slave = afro_caribbean }
link = { master = lusophone slave = afro_brazilian } # portugese
link = { master = hispanophone slave = afro_caribeno } # spanish
link = { master = francophone slave = afro_antillean } # french, belgians etc
