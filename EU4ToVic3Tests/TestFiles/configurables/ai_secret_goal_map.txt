# While this file is used to set some initial goals, keep in mind AI will change them over time, and large conquests or
# liberations might not be possible if the AI is too timid.
#
# Each goal gets points. One with most points is selected.
# Allowed: 
# * capital - our capital state/region/superregion
# * target_capital - target capital our capital state/region/superregion
# * target_capital_diff_region - yes/no - is the target capital in a different superregion
# * target_rank_leq - is [target rank - our rank] less or equal to value
# * target_rank_geq = is [target rank - our rank] greater or equal to value
# * target_subject - is target our subject
# * target_overlord - is target our overlord
# * target_is_rival - is target our rival?
# * target_gp - is target an EU4 GP?
# * gp - are we an EU4 GP?
# * target_is_claimed - does target have lands claimed by us?
# * target_is_claimed_by_rival - does target have lands claimed by OUR rival?
# * gov_form_diff - does target have different lawgroup_governance_principles law? eg. republic vs monarchy.
