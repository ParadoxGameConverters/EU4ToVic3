[h1]EU4 To Vic3 Converter[/h1]

Welcome to the EU4 to Vic3 Converter project! The goal of this project is to allow a Europa Universalis 4 campaign to be transferred and continued in Victoria 3, so you may continue your game uninterrupted, from 1444 to 1936, and further using our other converters from Crusader Kings 2/3 and to Hearts of Iron 4.

[h2]What is a converter?[/h2]

The converter is not a mod - it is a mod producing [i]application[/i] (program, software, tool, app). It takes a saved game from one game and produces a mod for the other game, thus, bridging two games and allowing players to embark on grand [b]mega-campaigns[/b].

[h2]Where do I get it?[/h2]

You can download the converter directly from our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/eu4-to-vic3-converter-thread.1475054/]forums thread[/url].

[h2]How does it work? How do I use the converter?[/h2]

Every converter has a detailed documentation available at its [url=https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/EU4_To_Vic3_Converter]wiki page[/url].

Every converter also contains a file: GeneralFAQ-READ.ME.FIRST.txt

Inside this file there are detailed instructions and answers to a vast majority of user questions.

[h2]Other Questions, Troubleshooting, Contact[/h2] 

We welcome any questions and will gladly help you out if you hit a problem. We will also answer any question not covered by the FAQ or wiki.

When seeking help, discussing conversion issues or problems, or if you simply need answers to your questions, come to our [url=https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/eu4-to-vic3-converter-thread.1475054/]Paradox forum thread[/url].

To resolve issues we will always need your conversion's [i][b]log.txt[/b][/i]. You can find it in your converter's folder after conversion. Upload your log.txt to the release thread, along with a detailed description of your problem. We may need additional data like your running savegame or mods used, which you can also upload to the forums directly.

Keep in mind Steam discussion below is [b]not suited[/b] to troubleshooting as you cannot upload files we need.
