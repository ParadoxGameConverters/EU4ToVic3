  exiles_more_events.8.f: ""Of course I'm going to try crossing the border! Who even listens to orders from the capital anymore? They're a bunch of jokes, like I've been saying all this time. This is going to be a cakewalk, trust me.""
  exiles_more_events.8.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('dgaf_exile_scope').GetSheHe|U] would cost too much to stop."
