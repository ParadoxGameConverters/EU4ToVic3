# Establish Treaty with Local Tribe

 zzz_cc_canada.1.d:0 "As settlers continue to move into lands held by Indians, conflicts arise; conflicts that could be avoided if prudent agreements were made with said Indians. By setting aside reserved land for the natives with a promise to provide them with supplies and education we may be able to gather the support of enough tribes to gain more direct control over [SCOPE.sState('canada_annex_state_scope').GetName] without a fight."
 zzz_cc_canada.1.f:0 ""The Indians inhabiting the district hereinafter described and defined do hereby cede, release, surrender and yield up to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] government and successors forever all the lands included within the following limits...""

Our days are numbered if we do not come to some sort of agreement about reserving land for us to live on."

		zzz_cc_canada.3.f:0 ""And the undersigned Chiefs do hereby bind and pledge themselves and their people strictly to observe this treaty and to maintain perpetual peace between themselves and the government's subjects, and not to interfere with the property or in any way molest the persons of the government's subjects.""

		zzz_cc_canada.4.t:0 "The [SCOPE.sState('canada_annex_state_scope').GetName] Rebellion"
		zzz_cc_canada.4.d:0 "It appears that our overtures to the chiefs of [SCOPE.sCountry('canada_annex_scope').GetName] have backfired. Firebrands among the [SCOPE.sCountry('canada_annex_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people have used this opportunity to stoke unwarranted fears of our people, leading to many reported atrocities against our settlers! We must crush these upstarts immediately!"
		zzz_cc_canada.4.f:0 ""You ask me if I will not be glad when the last battle is fought, so far as the country is concerned I, of course, must wish for peace, and will be glad when the war is ended, but if I answer for myself alone, I must say that I shall regret to see the war end.""

The flood of our citizens into land held in truth by [SCOPE.sCountry('canada_annex_scope').GetName] means that we may not necessarily be able to properly protect our people from the savages.

# Conflict with Local Tribe
 zzz_cc_australia.1.t:0 "Conflict With [SCOPE.sCountry('is_australia_scope').GetName]"
 zzz_cc_australia.1.d:0 "The foreigners have continued to invade our land with impunity, ignoring our laws and raiding our homes. Many of the elders have gathered and declared that the time has come to fight back and push these invaders out from our lands, or die trying. A vocal minority argues instead that an arrangement could still be reached with the elders of the invaders."
 zzz_cc_australia.1.f:0 ""There is always someone who wants to take something from us. I disapprove of that person, whoever he or she is.""

With this, we have attained a lasting peace for a safer and more secure future."

	zzz_cc_australia.3.d:0 "Our entreaties have fallen on deaf ears and violence continues to rage across [SCOPE.sState('australia_annex_state_scope').GetName]. We must put together an armed force and put down the aggressive Aborigines before they expand their power and influence!"
	zzz_cc_australia.3.f:0 ""It is a fatal error that a treaty was not entered into with the natives""
	zzz_cc_australia.3.a:0 "The massacres stop now!"
    
 zzz_cc_australia.4.t:0 "Conflict With [SCOPE.sCountry('australia_annex_scope').GetName]"
 zzz_cc_australia.4.d:0 "It appears that our expansion of the land grant system has led to increased hostility with the local Aborigines. Sheep and cattle have been found murdered by the flock and the stockmen have been thoroughly terrorized. We must consider the possibility of open conflict and war."
 zzz_cc_australia.4.f:0 ""The strength of these men is amazing. One of the chiefs (named Saturday) of a desperate tribe, took six men to secure him and they had actually to break a musket over his body before he yielded...""
 zzz_cc_australia.4.a:0 "The natives have been very troublesome."

 zzz_cc_australia.5.t:0 "Massacres In [SCOPE.sState('australia_annex_state_scope').GetName]"
 zzz_cc_australia.5.d:0 "In alarming news, it appears that massacres have been an increasing part of everyday life in [SCOPE.sState('australia_annex_state_scope').GetName]. The settlers blame the savage desire for our tempting goods and chattel, pointing to increased cattle raids. Regardless of the reason, settlers have been killed or injured and many have begun forming 'hunting parties' with the intent of fighting back against [SCOPE.sCountry('australia_annex_scope').GetName]."
 zzz_cc_australia.5.f:0 ""They went out an’ they shot ‘em an’ they come from every where to have a shoot against the Aboriginal race. An’ they shot women, kids and everything else an’ that wasn’t, you know they wouldn’t say how many they shot, they wouldn’t put that down, because it was sport to them, it was like shooting animals...""

 zzz_cc_australia.6.t:0 "Confederation Forms In [SCOPE.sState('australia_annex_state_scope').GetName]"
 zzz_cc_australia.6.d:0 "It appears that one of our settlers' deepest fears have been realized, the local tribes have begun banding together into a cohesive confederacy. If we don't crush it now, it may expand its reach and threaten our hold on this whole region!"
 zzz_cc_australia.6.f:0 ""Many a pretty bush station, has its humble mound neatly fenced, where sleeps the stockman or shepherd untimely slain by boomerang, spear or tomahawk...""
 zzz_cc_australia.6.a:0 "Prepare arms!"

 zzz_cc_australia.7.t:0 "Pastoralists Report Conflicts With [SCOPE.sCountry('australia_annex_scope').GetName]"
 zzz_cc_australia.7.d:0 "It all began when a pastoralist was charged with the murder of 'unknown aboriginal natives'. The pastoralist managed to evade jailtime. This incident is only unique in that it reached so far up the court system. This increased conflict between the natives and the pastoralists has now demanded our attention, and it may become necessary to employ force."
 zzz_cc_australia.7.f:0 ""We, the undersigned, settlers, and inhabitants of [SCOPE.sState('australia_annex_state_scope').GetName], beg respectfully to represent to your Honor the absence of any protection against the natives. Their number, their ferocity, and their cunning render them peculiarly formidable, and the outrages of which they are daily and nightly guilty, and which they accomplish generally with impunity and success, may, we fear, lead to a still more distressing state of things, unless some measures, prompt and effective, be immediately taken to prevent matters coming to that unhappy crisis.""
 zzz_cc_australia.7.a:0 "Must we always settle matters with arms?"

 zzz_cc_australia.8.t:0 "Governor Demands First Strike Against [SCOPE.sCountry('australia_annex_scope').GetName]"
 zzz_cc_australia.8.d:0 "Hostility between settlers and natives is expected and an almost natural state of affairs. However, one must never assume that the settlers necessarily have the upper hand, confederations of native peoples strike harder than many expect. Knowing this, and recognizing that a confederation may soon be forming, the government has determined that a pre-emptive strike would crush the natives before any alliances could be made."
 zzz_cc_australia.8.f:0 ""The first mob was caught, was just the other side of the Capel River (Mollakup). When I was a little boy we found some skulls up there. One of them had a bullet in it, it had gone through the forehead and just sticking out the back. There was quite a few with holes knocked in them in the skulls...""
 zzz_cc_australia.8.a:0 "The wounded are not to be suffered to escape!"
 zzz_cc_australia.8.b:0 "That would be an expensive overreaction."

We must establish our presence quickly, for the good of our citizens... and for the gold."
 zzz_cc_australia.9.f:0 ""There are numerous deposits of the precious metal at various localities in the Northern Territory. A rich find of gold has recently been reported and steps are being taken to open up this field by sinking wells to provide permanent water, of which there is a great scarcity in the district.""

 zzz_cc_australia.10.t:0 "War Engulfs [SCOPE.sCountry('australia_annex_scope').GetAdjective]"
 zzz_cc_australia.10.d:0 "Conflict with the Aborigines is not newsworthy in and of itself, however the scale of hostilities present in [SCOPE.sCountry('australia_annex_scope').GetAdjective] has surpassed normal levels. The settlers and police have begun forming what they call the 'Black Line' that stretches across the entire island. They say that they plan to march until the Aboriginal menace has been contained."
 zzz_cc_australia.10.f:0 ""It is perhaps at this time in vain to trace the cause of the evil which exists; my duty is plainly to remove its effects; and there does not appear any practicable method of accomplishing this measure, short of entirely prohibiting the Aborigines from entering the settled districts...""
 zzz_cc_australia.10.a:0 "We must declare martial law."
