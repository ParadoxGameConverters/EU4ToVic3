 # Liberal and Conservative Election Events

 election_liberal_events.1.d:0 "In their campaign for the upcoming election, the [SCOPE.sParty('liberal_party').GetName] have directed criticism at the [SCOPE.sParty('conservative_party').GetName] for allowing [SCOPE.sCharacter('extremist_leader').GetFullName] among their ranks, pointing to [SCOPE.sCharacter('extremist_leader').GetHerHis] far-right views as an example of the party accommodating extremists."
 election_liberal_events.1.f:0 ""They call themselves conservatives, in itself a void of values and ideals, but something even worse has grown within that void. Among their ranks there are those who would not only stand in the way of our country changing, but would want to shape its future to their own delusional ideas of a past that never existed — prepared to use any methods to achieve it. Do not cast your vote lightly, unless you want to take the first step on the road to war and genocide.""
 election_liberal_events.1.a:0 "Far from the traditional [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] values they claim."
 election_liberal_events.1.b:0 "[SCOPE.sCharacter('extremist_leader').GetLastName] is simply a dedicated patriot!"
 downplaying_fascism:0 "Allowed Discrimination"

 election_liberal_events.2.d:0 "The anarchist political group [SCOPE.sParty('anarchist_party').GetName]'s rise to prominence has been invoked in the [SCOPE.sParty('liberal_party').GetName] election campaign, casting themselves as the more reasonable alternative."
 election_liberal_events.2.f:0 ""The people want freedom, but from what? From laws, from governance, from organized society itself? Of course not; merely from unnecessary laws, bad governance and byzantine bureaucracy. Too many governments allow themselves to grow their excesses unchecked, like trees reaching their sprawling branches into every home and pocket until the people arrive with torches to burn them down. All this can be avoided with sensible pruning.""
 election_liberal_events.2.a:0 "True liberty takes time."

 election_liberal_events.3.f:0 ""When I go abroad, people tell me, '[SCOPE.sCharacter('pacifist_leader').GetFirstName], it's hopeless. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] are used to getting their way with violence and threats. Such people will never change.' I tell them the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people love peace, as do the people of all nations. That is why leaders use force and deceit to make them go to war. No more! The people will be heard and their reputation will be restored. If we can reclaim peace here, the whole world can!""
 election_liberal_events.3.a:0 "We are a peaceful nation now."
 election_liberal_events.3.b:0 "Our enemies should not stop fearing us, today or ever."
 election_liberal_events.4.t:0 "Open Markets"
 election_liberal_events.4.d:0 "The high prices on [SCOPE.sGoods('expensive_good').GetName] have become a prominent talking point in the [SCOPE.sParty('free_trade_campaign_party').GetName] election campaign, arguing that their free trade policies would drive down the price."
 election_liberal_events.4.f:0 ""Don't be fooled! Trade restrictions are not called protectionism because they protect you. They protect a select few profiteers, not from starvation or poverty, but from competition. They protect them from the world! They'd have you think you are safer with a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] boot on your neck than you would be free. It's time to stop protecting them.""
 election_liberal_events.4.a:0 "This is the age of the global market!"
 election_liberal_events.4.b:0 "Our current policies are needed to keep the economy stable."
 election_conservative_events.1.t:0 "Faithless Leaders"
 election_conservative_events.1.d:0 "The [SCOPE.sParty('liberal_party').GetName]'s endorsement of [SCOPE.sCharacter('atheist_leader').GetFullName] has come under attack by the [SCOPE.sParty('conservative_party').GetName] campaign, arguing that a leader who rejects religion can not be trusted to keep promises or maintain a sound moral compass."
 election_conservative_events.1.f:0 ""Upon what does such a [SCOPE.sCharacter('atheist_leader').GetWomanMan] swear? What punishment does [SCOPE.sCharacter('atheist_leader').GetSheHe] expect for breaking [SCOPE.sCharacter('atheist_leader').GetHerHis] word in secret? It appears the [SCOPE.sParty('liberal_party').GetName], in their pursuit of liberty, have forgotten the virtues needed to hold the free accountable.""
 election_conservative_events.1.a:0 "Those so poor in spirit cannot lead [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 election_conservative_events.1.b:0 "Perhaps [SCOPE.sCharacter('atheist_leader').GetLastName] sees things clearer unfettered by religious dogma."
 election_conservative_events.2.t:0 "Unity in Tradition"
 election_conservative_events.2.d:0 "In the light of the [concept_devastation] suffered by states like [SCOPE.sState('devastation_state').GetName], the [SCOPE.sParty('conservative_party').GetName] has campaigned on uniting [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in this trying time behind traditional values."
 election_conservative_events.2.f:0 ""Our nation lies in ruins, but [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] has risen from ashes before and will do so again, as long as we do not forget who we are. This is not the time for radicalism or recklessness. This is the time for healing. We must look to what has made us persevere in the past and safeguard it from those who would see it destroyed. Until we have rebuilt, until we have healed, it is all we have!""

 election_conservative_events.3.d:0 "Pointing to the rampant [concept_turmoil] from radical activities in [SCOPE.sState('turmoil_state').GetName], the [SCOPE.sParty('conservative_party').GetName] has campaigned on the platform of more policing."
 election_conservative_events.3.f:0 ""People seem to think the flimsiest of political pretexts can be used to justify the chaos we see in [SCOPE.sState('turmoil_state').GetName]. If they have not thought of a pretext yet, our opponents are more than happy to provide them with it. We will not! We must send a strong message to those who would make a mockery of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] law that they can not escape justice.""
 election_conservative_events.3.a:0 "This wound has been allowed to fester for too long."
 election_conservative_events.3.b:0 "The key to preventing crime is to prevent poverty."
 election_conservative_events.4.t:0 "The Best Defense"
 election_conservative_events.4.d:0 "Our neighbors in [SCOPE.sCountry('election_threatening_neighbor').GetName] have become known for their ruthless foreign policy, a concern that the [SCOPE.sParty('hawk_campaign_party').GetName] has raised in their election campaign, promising to be harsher in turn to deter aggression."
 election_conservative_events.4.f:0 ""The suggestion has been brought to me that our diplomats study more languages to facilitate connections around the world. That is all well and good, but we all know there is only one language a [SCOPE.sCountry('election_threatening_neighbor').GetAdjective] brute understands. They don't teach it in universities, but we better be ready to speak it if we want the border to stay where it is!""

 election_moderate_events.1.t:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName] of Conscience"
 election_moderate_events.1.d:0 "The rise of far-left and far-right political parties in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has led [SCOPE.sParty('moderate_party').GetName] to portray themselves as the voice of reason in the upcoming election, a moderate centrist alternative to extremism."
 election_moderate_events.1.f:0 ""Hearing some of the rhetoric used by my opponents, you would think they'd rather not have an election at all! For all their idealism, they hardly seem like they can wait to start spilling blood. What utopias can such hatred build? A road to heaven, paved with bad intentions.""
 election_moderate_events.1.a:0 "A sensible and stable option for voters."
 election_moderate_events.1.b:0 "On the contrary, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] politics could use some shaking up!"
 election_moderate_events.2.t:0 "The Red Menace"
 election_moderate_events.2.d:0 "The rise of communism in powerful countries like [SCOPE.sCountry('communist_country').GetName] has become a talking point in the [SCOPE.sParty('moderate_party').GetName] election campaign, warning against a similar homegrown movement."
 election_moderate_events.2.f:0 ""It is no secret that the communists seek an international revolution. The [SCOPE.sCountry('communist_country').GetAdjective] regime may topple any day now, but that does not mean we can take the threat of another government falling lightly. Whether they call themselves democratic socialists, or syndicalists, or any of these other products of leftist factionalism, they are all a threat to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] values.""
 election_moderate_events.2.a:0 "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] streets will not run red, with blood or otherwise!"
