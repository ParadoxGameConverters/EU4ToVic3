 zzz_cc_australia.4.d:0 "It appears that our expansion of the land grant system has led to increased hostility with the local Aborigines. Sheep and cattle have been found murdered by the flock and the stockmen have been thoroughly terrorized. We must consider the possibility of open conflict and war."

 zzz_cc_australia.7.d:0 "It all began when a pastoralist was charged with the murder of 'unknown aboriginal natives'. The pastoralist managed to evade jailtime. This incident is only unique in that it reached so far up the court system. This increased conflict between the natives and the pastoralists has now demanded our attention, and it may become necessary to employ force."
 zzz_cc_australia.7.f:0 ""We, the undersigned, settlers, and inhabitants of [SCOPE.sState('australia_annex_state_scope').GetName], beg respectfully to represent to your Honor the absence of any protection against the natives. Their number, their ferocity, and their cunning render them peculiarly formidable, and the outrages of which they are daily and nightly guilty, and which they accomplish generally with impunity and success, may, we fear, lead to a still more distressing state of things, unless some measures, prompt and effective, be immediately taken to prevent matters coming to that unhappy crisis.""

 zzz_cc_australia.8.d:0 "Hostility between settlers and natives is expected and an almost natural state of affairs. However, one must never assume that the settlers necessarily have the upper hand, confederations of native peoples strike harder than many expect. Knowing this, and recognizing that a confederation may soon be forming, the government has determined that a pre-emptive strike would crush the natives before any alliances could be made."
 zzz_cc_australia.8.f:0 ""The first mob was caught, was just the other side of the Capel River (Mollakup). When I was a little boy we found some skulls up there.

 zzz_cc_australia.10.f:0 ""It is perhaps at this time in vain to trace the cause of the evil which exists; my duty is plainly to remove its effects; and there does not appear any practicable method of accomplishing this measure, short of entirely prohibiting the Aborigines from entering the settled districts...""
