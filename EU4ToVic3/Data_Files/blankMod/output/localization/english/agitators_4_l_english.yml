  #nihilism.1 and all attached things are in content_1.
  nihilism.2.t: "Nothing Ends"
  nihilism.2.d: "The rigorous suppression of the nihilist movement has finally borne fruit, as the word "nihilism" becomes nothing but an obscenity once more."
  nihilism.2.f: ""Your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing."" # -Dostoevsky
  nihilism.2.a: "They were more trouble than they had any right to be."
  nihilism.2.b: "Use this to reassert our control over the academia."

  nihilism.3.t: "Into Oblivion"
  nihilism.3.d: "The conflict within the nihilist movement has finally led it to burn itself out, but the spirit of radicalism is not gone. Former nihilists have flocked to other radical movements in droves."
  nihilism.3.f: ""...you think I am attacking them for talking nonsense? Not a bit! I like them to talk nonsense. That's [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('WomanManMatriarchal')]'s one privilege over all creation. Through error you come to the truth! I am a [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('WomanManMatriarchal')] because I err! You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can't even make mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense, and I'll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one's own way is better than to go right in someone else's."" #- Also Dostoevsky
  nihilism.3.a: "Only a taste of the conflict to come."
  nihilism.3.b: "Let them fade into the past."

  nihilism.4.t: "Condemnations of the Children"
  nihilism.4.d: "A popular member of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective]  [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_ig').GetName] has released a novel condemning the trend of nihilistic excess amongst the youth. The main character, professing vocal nihilism, bears a resemblance to [SCOPE.sCharacter('nihilist_scope').GetFullName]."
  nihilism.4.f: ""The fact is that previously they were simply dunces and now they've suddenly become nihilists."" # -Also Turgenev
  nihilism.4.a: "At least one of them has some sense."
  nihilism.4.b: "Isn't the main character dashing, though?"

  nihilism.5.t: "Black Coats and Feuerbach"
  nihilism.5.d: "Students embracing the aesthetic and attitude of nihilism have become more and more common at [SCOPE.sState('university_nihilist_affected_state').GetStateRegion.GetName] [SCOPE.sBuilding('university_nihilist_affected_building').GetName], and numerous parties have raised concerns about radicalism in academia."
  nihilism.5.f: ""The tiny space I occupy is so infinitely small in comparison with the rest of space, in which I am not, and which has nothing to do with me; and the period of time in which it is my lot to live is so petty beside the eternity in which I have not been, and shall not be.... And in this atom, this mathematical point, the blood is circulating, the brain is working and wanting something.... Isn't it loathsome? Isn't it petty?"" #Turgenev, Fathers and Sons
  nihilism.5.a: "The only education these people deserve is from the school of hard knocks!"
  nihilism.5.b: "This is a matter for university authorities."

  nihilism.6.t: "A Deficit of Respect"
  nihilism.6.d: "A [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('ManWomanMatriarchal')] affiliated with the [GetPopType('aristocrats').GetName] of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_ig').GetName] has angrily reported an incident of a group of students refusing to stand aside for [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HimHerMatriarchal')] on the side of the road, and teasing [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HimHerMatriarchal')] as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HeSheMatriarchal')] walked by."
  nihilism.6.f: ""Have you no respect at all?"\n\n"What does it matter if your skirts must trail in the snow? Their worth is the same whether they're stained or not—the same value as any such garment."\n\n"The authorities will hear of this!"\n\nThe sneers of the students with their shaggy hair and black coats followed [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HimHerMatriarchal')] as [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HeSheMatriarchal')] hurried away, red-faced."
  nihilism.6.a: "How far can these nihilists' depravity go?"
  nihilism.6.b: "Hardly a matter for the legal system."

  nihilism.7.t: "Chaos on the Courtyard"
  nihilism.7.d: "In visiting [SCOPE.sState('courtyard_chaos_affected_state').GetStateRegion.GetName] [SCOPE.sBuilding('courtyard_chaos_affected_building').GetName], [SCOPE.sCharacter('nihilist_scope').GetFullName] has stirred up an impressive crowd of students, and disrupted the activities of several people affiliated with the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('wronged_by_nihilists_ig').GetName]."
  nihilism.7.f: "The performer on the soapbox turned their attention to several unlucky souls in the clothing of the upper class, and stretched out an arm.\n\n"See them as they walk by, those agents of nefarious superstition? Yes, see how they hide their faces in shame? The truth is that they're no better than any one of us!""
  nihilism.7.a: "Enough with this nonsense! Break up the demonstration."
  nihilism.7.b: "We cannot deny it was a good show."

  nihilism.8.t: "Unholy Activities"
  nihilism.8.d: "A group of nihilist students has carried out an obscene and outlandish protest in front of a church, prompting demands by the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('devout_ig').GetName] to halt these activities by force."
  nihilism.8.f: "The vicar, standing outside to sweep the path to the entryway of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HerHisMatriarchal')] church, could only stare in shock as the exultant students dressed as clergy untied and flung their frocks into the air. Dark cloth formed brief clouds in the air. At the sight of their bare flesh [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('SheHeMatriarchal')] turned [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HerHisMatriarchal')] head and shielded [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HerHisMatriarchal')] vision with [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('HerHisMatriarchal')] hands.\n\n"Do you have no sense at all?!""
  nihilism.8.a: "Track down everyone involved, and charge them with blasphemy!"
  nihilism.8.b: "How do they expect us to identify the perpetrators?"

  nihilism.9.t: "Taxes and Torches"
  nihilism.9.d: "In the dead of night, a group of nihilists have committed arson against a [SCOPE.sBuilding('kissed_by_fire_building').GetName] in [SCOPE.sState('kissed_by_fire_state').GetStateRegion.GetName], leading to it being severely damaged by fire."
  nihilism.9.f: ""You cry out with rage when empty buildings burn, but where are your tears when [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('WomenMenMatriarchal')] and [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('MenWomenMatriarchal')] with full hearts perish from hunger?""
  nihilism.9.a: "The perpetrators will rebuild what they destroyed in prison."
  nihilism.9.b: "The classrooms will be shuttered until that building is restored."

  nihilism.10.t: "The Wedge in the Academia"
  nihilism.10.d: "With the rise in discontent amongst the academia, a new, proudly [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_ig').GetLeader.GetIdeology.GetName] leader of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_ig').GetName] has come to the fore."
  nihilism.10.f: ""The life of a limited person almost always flows more smoothly and pleasantly than the life of a genius or even just an intelligent person. Clever people do not get along with those phenomena to which the masses become accustomed without the slightest difficulty. Intelligent people, depending on the various conditions of temperament and development, are in the most heterogeneous relationship to these phenomena."" #- Dmitry Pisarev
  nihilism.10.a: "Keep a close eye on [SCOPE.sCharacter('nihilist_leader').GetFullName]."
  nihilism.10.b: "Perhaps [SCOPE.sCharacter('nihilist_leader').GetSheHe] is simply a product of our actions."

  nihilism.11.t: "A Forum Argument"
  nihilism.11.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('nihilist_scope').GetFullName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('communist_scope').GetFullName] have found themselves in a spontaneous public argument about the merits of their respective ideologies."
  nihilism.11.f: ""How are you to ever acquire support for your movement beyond the gullible scions of the bourgeoisie?", the [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('WomanManMatriarchal')] in the red scarf shouted. "You have nothing but aesthetics behind you, the very thing you condemn!"\n\nWith a turn of a black coat, the nihilist's eyes met their opponent. "You clearly possess no faith in the will of the people once awakened...""
  nihilism.11.a: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('nihilist_scope').GetFullName] comes to a victory over [SCOPE.sCharacter('nihilist_scope').GetHerHis] opponent!"
  nihilism.11.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('communist_scope').GetFullName] clearly possesses stronger arguments."
  nihilism.11.c: "They have potential for something larger than the sum of its parts."

  nihilism.12.t: "The Red and Black Unite"
  nihilism.12.d: "Spurred by close ties between their respective agitators, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('communist_ig').GetName] and [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('intelligentsia_ig').GetName] have begun to cooperate against the influence of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('devout_ig').GetName]."
  nihilism.12.f: "They formed an odd pairing, the bright-eyed students clearly trying to ape the ragged style of the workers, and yet they seemed to complete one another. In the flickering candlelight of the basement, the shabby clothing of the nihilists almost seemed to possess an authentic nature, for here they knew they had signed a compact to suffer equally if they were caught."
  nihilism.12.a: "The product of zero times two is still zero."
  nihilism.12.b: "Surely the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('communist_ig').GetName] cannot actually be united behind this absurdity."

  nihilism.13.t: "Spiraling Ascension"
  nihilism.13.d: "The ascendant nihilist sympathisers in the government have arranged a gambit to abolish and forcefully liquidate all property of the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('devout_ig').GetName], and immediately enact [SCOPE.sLaw('current_law_scope').GetName]."
  nihilism.13.f: ""What can be smashed must be smashed. Whatever withstands the blow is fit to survive; what flies into pieces is rubbish. In any case, strike out right and left, no harm can come of it."" # -Pisarev
  nihilism.13.a: "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('devout_ig').GetName] will perish, for it stands against reality itself!"
  nihilism.13.b: "This path is doomed to fail!"

These delays have gone on long enough."\n\n"Of course His Majesty's will be done, and with the utmost care and alacrity.
