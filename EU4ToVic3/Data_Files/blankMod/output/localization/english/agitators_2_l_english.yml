hispaniola_events.3.d: "The country of [SCOPE.sCountry('haiti_scope').GetName], suffering under a massive indemnity owed us for the exchange of their freedom, has requested a renegotiation of the terms."
hispaniola_events.3.f: ""As a humble servant of [SCOPE.sCountry('haiti_scope').GetNameNoFormatting]'s National Assembly, and the treasury of this nation, it is my duty to inform you that the indemnity we are bound to is beyond our means. The means to remove the iron manacles has only seen it become paper bindings instead. Surely you must understand having your wings crushed by debt.

hispaniola_events.4.f: "Your letter arrived to me in good faith, and I must say that I am dismayed. We had received full assurances your island nation was able to remunerate our lost costs.

hispaniola_events.5.t: "France Refuses Indemnity Reduction"
hispaniola_events.5.d: "In yet another display of colonial arrogance, [SCOPE.sCountry('france_scope').GetName] has refused any and all suggestions to reduce the indemnity — the [SCOPE.sCountry('france_scope').GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] representative instead launched into a tirade about financial obligations and the horrors of Saint Domingue."
hispaniola_events.5.f: ""So what will we tell the people now? That we bleed them as badly as the French?"\n\n"No... no, we cannot. They've suffered enough."\n\n"We cannot default this payment, or we will invite the French back. Whoever we beg may put us in irons faster than them, too.""
