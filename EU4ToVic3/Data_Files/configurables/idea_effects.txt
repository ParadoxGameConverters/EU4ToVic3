# literacy = <+-number> <- negative or positive literacy percentage, that's about it.
# eg. if a country's percentage would be 49%, and this would bump them to 51%, they might
# switch the rating from high to very high literacy. Little in-game effect though.
#
# adm, dip, mil = <+-number> <- these count as extra (or missing) techs in this category.
# This is relevant when scoring nations to assign starting tech.
#
# ig = <group> <- having this idea group means you are boosting these guys.
# noig = <group> <- this idea would supress this interest group.
# If an IG gets boosted two or more times, it also becomes one of the ruling IGs.
