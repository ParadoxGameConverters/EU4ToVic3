# This file is used when generating language definitions for any culture NOT already defined. 
# This means when importing flemish (already defined) we won't create a new def, but when importing
#    dynamic-flemish-russian-culture-num3, we will be using both flemish and east_slavic entries.
# Relevant to this is also name_list_map.txt which graps appropriate namelist for the culture being defines.
#
# Example usage:
# link = { language = X_language eu4 = culture1 eu4group = culturegroup1 } -> list individual cultures BEFORE group fallbacks!
# There can be as many cultures and groups as needed
# There must be a SINGLE language

#Mapping Order: The converter first searches for EU4 cultures, THEN if, and only if, it cannot find a matching EU4 culture, does it map by EU4 Culture Group.
#This means that you do NOT need to order the EU4 cultures so that they appear before EU4 Culture Groups, since the cultures will always map before the mapper starts looking for culture groups.
