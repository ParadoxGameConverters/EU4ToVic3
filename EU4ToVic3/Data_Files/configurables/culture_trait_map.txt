# This file is used when generating culture definitions for any culture NOT already defined. 
# This means wen importing flemish (already defined) we won't create a new def, but when importing
#    dynamic-flemish-russian-culture-num3, we will be using both flemish and east_slavic entries.
# Relevant to this is also name_list_map.txt which graps appropriate namelist for the culture being defines.
#
# Example usage:
# link = { eu4 = A trait = B ethnicity = C } -> list individual cultures BEFORE group fallbacks!
# link = { eu4group = X trait = Y ethnicity = Z }
# There can be as many traits as needed and they are also optional
# There must be either a SINGLE culture or SINGLE culture_group
# There must be a SINGLE ethnicity

# Cultures that change between culture groups
