# Cultures in files named 99_<...>.txt will get exported into the conversion mod. 
# Their names will be auto-normalized and keyed, with locs exported.
# cultures in other files (01_<...>txt) will not get exported separately.
# Cultures in blankmod get copied by default with no processing. DO NOT use 99_files in this folder in blankmod!

# If this is blankmod folder, add cultures to files not starting with 99_ so they get copied and not additionally exported. Also make SURE their names are ascii with existing locs!
# If this decentralized world, add cultures to 99_files so they get processed and exported as they won't get copied.
