## Slave generation
# For countries whose primary culture has a listed Vic3 master culture trait, all slaves in it will be re-assigned another culture
# Usage:
# link = { slave = [culture] masterLanguage = [language] (AND/OR)masterHeritage = [heritage] }
# Mapping searches for the language first, then the heritage if no language is matched.
# If a master culture has no slave culture defined, slaves will be of the same culture as master ones
# The calculation is done BEFORE colonial culture dynamic generation

link = { slave = afro_american masterHeritage = heritage_british } #British
link = { slave = afro_brazilian masterLanguage = language_lusophone } # Portugese
link = { slave = afro_caribeno masterLanguage = language_hispanophone masterHeritage = heritage_iberian } # Spanish
link = { slave = afro_antillean masterLanguage = language_francophone masterHeritage = heritage_gallic } # French, Belgians etc
