### Merging the Daimyos of Japan

# This entry is unique for automatically mapping daimyos into Japan.
# Daimyos are detected specifically, merge into JAP, and default to merging.

merge_daimyos = yes

### Merging other nations

# You may add your own entries here if you wish, or find the ones you like and set "merge = yes".
# Each entry contains ONE master and N slave tags, and a "merge" statement which can be "yes" (enabled) or "no" (disabled).
# ALL TAGS ARE EU4 TAGS!  Merging is done BEFORE conversion!  "master" should have a one-to-one mapping for best results.
