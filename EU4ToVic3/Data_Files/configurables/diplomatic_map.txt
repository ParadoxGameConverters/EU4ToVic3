# EU4 agreement types map directly to Vic3 ones.
# You can list a certain agreement in multiple categories (both types and boosts).
# Since all agreements will break on poor relations (unlike eu4), we don't have agreement penalties.

# AGREEMENT TYPES:
# DO NOT ALTER LEFT SIDE, ONLY RIGHT!
# Single-sided agreements

# RELATIONSHIP BOOSTS:
# You can alter both left and right side. Can also make left negative.
