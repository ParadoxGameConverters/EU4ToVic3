# Everything in this file only applies when EUROCENTRISIM is enabled.
#
# This file allows cultural traits to affect westernization of the country, should this option be enabled in the converter. 
# This is done by describing a level of westernization, industry and literacy for a country with a culture (or multiples) that have these traits.
# This file completely supercedes ANY EU4 tech levels.
# 
# Scale for westernization is 0 to 10 where:
# 0 - These are stone-age people - ["euro-civlevel" zet to 0]
# 5 - Uncivilized but not primitive tribes of north africa - ["euro-civlevel" zet to 50]
# 10 - A modern tea-drinking Man-o-war sailing colonial empire - ["euro-civlevel" zet to 100]
#
# If the economy configuration is set to CIVLEVEL, westernization strongly influences the amount of buildings a country gets to build.
#
# You can also set increased or decreased literacy to a particular cultural trait, where:
# 0 - These people are illiterate. - [literacy is capped by "euro-civlevel"% and then halved]
# 5 - Standard levels of literacy for this group - [literacy is capped by "euro-civlevel"%]
# 10 - Extraordinarily literate aliens from Atlantis - [literacy is capped by "euro-civlevel"% and then boosted 50%]
#
# You can also set increased or decreased industrial score to a particular cultural trait, where:
# 0 - No industry - [industry is calculated for "euro-civlevel"% and then zeroed]
# 5 - Standard levels of industry for this group - [industry is calculated for "euro-civlevel"%]
# 10 - Extraordinarily industrial aliens from Atlantis - [industry is calculated for "euro-civlevel"% and then doubled]
#
# Industry score mainly effects those sectors marked industrial in configurables/economy/national_budget.txt
# It does NOT effect the total number of buildings built, just the types.
# Those with an Industry score below 2 will struggle to build any urban buildings
#
# So how does this work? Without westernization we use "civlevel" - which is basically
# 	124 - missingTechs * 4 - missingInstitutions * 8, capped at 100.
# meaning one can be 6 techs behind the world leader and will still be considered civilized. 
# If the score is below 100, that's "unrecognized" territory.
# If the score is below 20, that's "decentralized" territory.
# 
# With eurocentrism, we override that civlevel score with euro-civlevel 100 for westernization 10 countries, completely ignoring tech.
# For others we have 2 cases:
# - if civlevel (from tech) is >20 and <100, we take the minimum from civlevel and euro-civlevel, so there is greater variety
# 	in technological levels across the world. This also means westernization [0,1] countries will always be decentralized.
# - if civlevel <20 (horrible horrible tech, potentially "eurocentric institutions etc") we take the higher of civlevel and euro-civlevel,
#	so that countries that's normally score higher get out of decentralized territory.
